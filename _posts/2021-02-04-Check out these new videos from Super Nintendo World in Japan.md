Today, the fan site Universal Parks News Today dropped a slew of videos from inside Japan's Super Nintendo World that show what the whole experience of going to the park is like. It's a cool look at what's sure to be a very popular post-COVID destination for Nintendo fans. From what I can tell, the park seems stuffed with people and attractions. It looks surprisingly normal, though everyone is wearing a mask. They went on every ride! They tried all the food! It's guaranteed to make you want to go yourself.
