Today at Amazon, you can find several gaming accessories for less than they usually cost. There are a few devices that are worth calling out, one of which is Asus' 24-inch G-Sync-compatible monitor. This 1080p monitor (TN panel, model VG248QG) has a 0.5-second response time, and supports up to a 165Hz refresh rate. Normally around $270, it's $190 right now.
