Zendure's SuperTank portable battery that's capable of delivering up to 100W of power to charge your laptop normally costs $129 at Amazon, but you can clip a coupon on its product page to save $10. Add it to your cart, then to get an additional 30 percent off the battery, add one of its $10 USB-C to Lightning cables or any other charger, hub, or cable that Zendure makes on this page to your cart. You'll then see the price drop at checkout. The final price will vary depending on what you buy, but for the battery and the cable I mentioned above, my final price was $87 before tax. Your price may vary depending on which color you choose.
