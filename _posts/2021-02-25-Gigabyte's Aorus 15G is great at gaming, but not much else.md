Gigabyte's refreshed Aorus 15G for 2021 has a subtle, all-black design that takes a page from the company's more svelte Aero lineup of creator-focused laptops. It's a nice upgrade, but there aren't many other changes from last year's model, for better or worse. It offers the same wide variety of ports (including the all-too-rare full-size SD card reader), and impressively, Gigabyte fit an excellent 15.6-inch display into a 14-inch wide chassis. But at the same time, the keyboard is cramped and the nostril webcam is awkward to use.
