Motorola has announced two new budget phones coming to European markets: the Moto G30 and the Moto G10, both starting well under xe2x82xac200. The higher-specced G30 includes a fast 90Hz refresh rate screen and a 5,000mAh battery with 15W fast charging, two features not commonly seen at this price.
