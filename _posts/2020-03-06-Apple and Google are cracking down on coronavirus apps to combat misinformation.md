Both Apple and Google have begun cracking down on apps related to the coronavirus, according to a new report from CNBC. App developers who spoke with the news organization say Apple is rejecting any and all coronavirus-related mobile software not from recognized health organizations or the government. CNBC also reports that Google is not returning any results for coronavirus-related searches on the Play Store, although it's unclear at this time if Google is restricting the approval of new apps, too.
