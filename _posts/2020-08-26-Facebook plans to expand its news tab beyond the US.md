Facebook is planning to expand its dedicated news section and says it is “considering” the UK, Germany, France, India, and Brazil as possible recipients, it announced Tuesday. The company's timeline is vague: “within the next six months to a year,” so it's curious why Facebook would announce something not yet imminent. But given Facebook's volatile history with the news industry, and the trend toward requiring platforms to pay news outlets for their content, it's possible the company is simply testing the waters for its next move.
