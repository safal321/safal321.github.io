Woot is offering the best price yet on the bean-shaped Samsung Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds. This model has gone as low as $130 during Black Friday, but they're currently at $110 for Cyber Monday. Given that the Galaxy Buds Live debuted at $170 in the summer alongside the Note 20-series phones, this is a sharp price drop in a short period of time.
