Tesla accounts can now be secured with two-factor authentication (2FA), giving owners an extra layer of security around their cars' connected services, Electrek reports. A support page on Tesla's website outlining how to set up the feature says any third-party authenticator apps can be used to provide the passcodes. There's no mention of support for 2FA codes over less secure SMS. Users on Twitter have confirmed that the enhanced security works across both the Tesla app and website.
