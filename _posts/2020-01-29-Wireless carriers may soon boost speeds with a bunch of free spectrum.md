Wireless carriers are expected to start boosting LTE speeds and augmenting their 5G rollouts later this year with a swath of spectrum that, as of this week, is finally ready for commercial use. Many popular phones — including Apple's iPhone 11, Samsung's Galaxy S10, and Google's Pixel 4 — already support the spectrum, so it's possible people in the US will start benefiting from the new deployments later this year.
