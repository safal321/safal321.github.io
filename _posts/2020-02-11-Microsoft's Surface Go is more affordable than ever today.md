Last week, I featured a $599 deal from Best Buy on a Microsoft Surface Go bundled with a Type Cover keyboard. The tablet alone usually costs $549, so it was a great deal. But if you waited, there's an even better deal happening now at B&H Photo and Best Buy. The high-end Surface Go configuration with 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD is $399 at B&H Photo, and you'll find the link below. Note that this deal is just for the tablet, so you'll need to get the Type Cover separately.
