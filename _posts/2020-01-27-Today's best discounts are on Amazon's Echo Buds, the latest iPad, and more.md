Today's best deals are a mix of fresh offers we're seeing for the first time and a few returning favorites. The headliner is Amazon's Echo Buds, which are $40 off right now, bringing the truly wireless earphones down to a much more reasonable $90. If you're looking for a set of affordable wireless earbuds that offer noise cancellation, your search is over. Despite the annoyance of charging these via Micro USB, you won't find a better value.
