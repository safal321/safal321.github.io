It's worth replaying through Half-Life: Alyx from start to finish once more — if only because Valve's development team just added over three hours of audio commentary to the VR-only game that launched earlier this year. In the commentary mode, you'll encounter clips at 147 points of interest in the game, covering several corners of development, including design, art, animation, rendering, sound, and more. Valve endearingly shared that the development team in Seattle recorded the commentary “in closets and blanket forts.”
