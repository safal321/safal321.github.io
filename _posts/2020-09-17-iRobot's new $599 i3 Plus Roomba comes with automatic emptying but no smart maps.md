iRobot has announced a pair of new midrange vacuum cleaners that have some of the perks of its top-range models but a few compromises, too. They are the $599 i3 Plus, which comes with the company's automatic bin-emptying station, capable of holding 60 days' worth of dirt, and the plain old $399 i3, which has no emptying station but is otherwise identical.
