A few weeks ago, I highlighted a $100 deal on a refurbished set of Jabra Elite 75t headphones. That price remains unbeatable, though if you aren't wanting to go down the refurbished route, a brand-new set is more affordable than ever at Amazon and Best Buy. These normally cost $180, but you can get them now for $150.
