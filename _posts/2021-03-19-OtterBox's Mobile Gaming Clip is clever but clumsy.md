OtterBox, the company best known for its ruggedized cases, has developed a $30 clip that can attach your phone to an Xbox controller for playing games. Called the Mobile Gaming Clip, it's part of a growing trend of accessories for playing cloud-based console games right on your phone. What makes OtterBox's clip different is it can also work as a phone stand, separate from the controller â€” although the phone stand feature isn't quite as robust as what I was hoping for.
