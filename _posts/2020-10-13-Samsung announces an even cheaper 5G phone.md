Samsung has announced the Galaxy A42 5G, the latest in its lineup of more reasonably priced and lower-specced A-series phones. The A42 is now Samsung's cheapest phone with 5G, selling for xc2xa3349 (about $455 USD). That puts it xc2xa380 below the Galaxy A51 5G, which was previously the cheapest way to buy into Samsung's 5G lineup at xc2xa3429 (or priced at $500 USD in the US).
