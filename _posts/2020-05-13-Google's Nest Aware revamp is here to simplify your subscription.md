Google's new Nest Aware pricing model is rolling out starting this week, the company announced today. The new model means that a single subscription now covers all of your Nest devices, rather than asking you to pay on a per-device basis. It's available in each of the 19 markets where Nest Aware is available, including the US, UK, Australia, France, and Germany.
