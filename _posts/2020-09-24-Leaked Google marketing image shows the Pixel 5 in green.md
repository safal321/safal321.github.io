The Google Pixel 5 is rumored to launch in a new green color (green-ish? green-like?) in addition to black, but you don't have to wait until later this month to see what that will look like. That very configuration of Google's upcoming flagship phone seems to be laid bare in a leaked marketing shot, spotted by WinFuture (via 9to5Google). The phone is face-down on its screen, leaving its rear fingerprint sensor and all-plastic back visible, and both details line up with the rumors so far.
