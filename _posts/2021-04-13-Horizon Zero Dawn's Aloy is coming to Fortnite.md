Aloy, star of Sony's 2017 open-world hit Horizon Zero Dawn, will soon be dropping on Fortnite's battle royale island. The character will be available in the game's item shop starting on April 15th, with a bundle that includes cosmetics like a Glinthawk glider. Given that Horizon takes place in a world that's both sci-fi and prehistoric, Aloy should feel right at home in Fortnite's current “Primal” season.
