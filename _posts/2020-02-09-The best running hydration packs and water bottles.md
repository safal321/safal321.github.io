While most races provide aid stations with water or Gatorade along the course, it isn't always as easy to quench your thirst when you're running on your own. Fortunately, there are lots of options for carrying water with you — handheld bottles, of course, but also more technical waist packs and even vests. Andy Waterman, a marathoner and head of content at the running apparel brand Tracksmith, explains one reason why you might consider wearing a so-called hydration pack: “They let you explore new routes where water might not be available while still practicing with the fuel you'll use on race day.”
