Google is launching a new Kids section for the Google Play Store, which will offer a selection of so-called “Teacher Approved” apps. The search giant says these are apps that meet its quality standards and are highly rated by teachers. Each approved app includes a list of reasons why teachers like it, including age-appropriateness, and what it's trying to teach children.
