Google is getting into mobile banking through a new partnership announced on Monday with a total of eight US-based banks, including the US division of the Bank of Montreal (BMO) and BBVA. The bank accounts will exist entirely within Google Pay, with customers able to access checking accounts handled digitally on the front end by Google while partner banks handle the infrastructure, FDIC insurance, and other backend technology.
