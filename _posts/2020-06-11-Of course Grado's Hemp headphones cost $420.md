Grado is no stranger to building headphones out of weird and wonderful materials. Alongside its regular excellent-sounding pairs, it's made limited editions out of whiskey barrels (with design help from Elijah Wood no less), wood from a yoghurt mill, and even the pistons of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Now, it's turning its attention to hemp, using it to produce a pair of Hemp Headphone Limited Edition cans costing, wait for it, $420.
