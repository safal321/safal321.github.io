Today, HP announced several new laptops in its Envy lineup, adding affordable alternatives to the company's more expensive Spectre lineup. This includes a redesigned 13-inch version of its Envy ultrabook, which is now equipped with Intel's 10th Gen i7-1065G7 Ice Lake processor with Iris Plus graphics. The design improvements made to the Envy 13 echo similar changes made in late 2019 to the excellent Spectre x360, such as a smaller footprint, taking up less space on your desk with what appears to be little compromise with features.
