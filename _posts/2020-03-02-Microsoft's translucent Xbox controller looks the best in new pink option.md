Microsoft has already released two translucent Phantom Xbox controllers in white and black, but the company now has the best color yet: magenta. The latest translucent design fades to a dark pink, and like all modern Xbox controllers, includes Bluetooth support and a textured grip. Preorders for the new controller begin today for $69.99, and it will be available on March 17th.
