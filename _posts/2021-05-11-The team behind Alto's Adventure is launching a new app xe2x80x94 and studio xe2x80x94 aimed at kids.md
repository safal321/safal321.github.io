Snowman is best-known for games like Alto's Adventure and Skate City, but soon the company will be exploring a very different realm: children's apps. Today, Snowman announced an upcoming game called Pok Pok Playroom, which will be launching on May 20th on the App Store. It's a charming, minimalist experience aimed at kids between two and six, designed to encourage open-ended play through a handful of different digital toys. But Pok Pok isn't just an app, it's also the name of a brand-new creative studio spun off from Snowman that will be explicitly focused on making these kinds of experiences.
