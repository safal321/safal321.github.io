Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It's never a bad idea to wait until there's a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. The latest model, the Apple Watch Series 5 starts at $400, but it's frequently available for $100 less than that. If that's a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $100 off that price for the Series 3 Watch.
