Dell is adding a new color option to its popular XPS 15 laptop for the first time ever, and it's a huge visual upgrade to the usual silver aluminum and black carbon fiber of the standard model. Dell is calling the color option frost, and it comes with a ”frost machined aluminum with arctic white woven glass palm rest,” the company says (via CNET). The frost version will run you an additional $50 when it becomes available later this summer.
