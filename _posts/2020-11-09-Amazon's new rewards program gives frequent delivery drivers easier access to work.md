Amazon is rolling out a new rewards program that gives its Flex delivery drivers easier access to shifts based on the amount of work they've done for the company. A spokesperson from Amazon confirmed to CNBC that the Flex Rewards program is in its early stages, but is being rolled out to all drivers in the US. As well as access to shifts, the program also includes access to a cash back debit card, as well as discounts and financial services.
