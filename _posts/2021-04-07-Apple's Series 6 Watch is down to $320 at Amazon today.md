Over at Amazon, you can save $80 on the Apple Watch Series 6. Normally $400, you can buy the 40mm model with GPS for only $320 if you buy the wearable in red. The sale price on the product listing notes $385, but the retailer will knock an additional $65 off that price at checkout to bring it down to $320.
