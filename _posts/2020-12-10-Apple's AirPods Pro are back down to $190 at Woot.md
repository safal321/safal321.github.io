If you're struggling to think of a gift for someone in your life, it's hard to fail with a good set of headphones. Thankfully, many of the best models currently available have seen sharp discounts in the lead-up to the holidays. Today's standout deals are on the Apple AirPods Pro at Woot for $190 (around $220 everywhere else). Now that the $550 AirPods Max are a thing, the Pro is no longer the most expensive model. Also worth sharing today is a deal on Microsoft's Surface Headphones, a noise-canceling over-ear model for $150 instead of its usual $200 asking price.
