Using a password manager is one of the best steps you can take to protect your security online. A good password manager makes it easy to generate unique, strong passwords, and it will then securely save them so they're available wherever you need them, whether that's on your phone, laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Basically, they take 90 percent of the work out of being safe online.
