The Interface Live is back! To kick off 2020, we're hosting a virtual discussion between The Verge's Casey Newton and Bloomberg reporter Sarah Frier, author of the new book No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram. In her book, Frier rewrites our understanding of Instagram, showing how the independence originally promised to co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger began to evaporate almost as soon as they were acquired by Facebook. In a freewheeling live discussion, The Interface's Casey Newton will talk with Frier about the hidden history of one of the world's most popular apps â€” as well as Instagram's present and uncertain future.
