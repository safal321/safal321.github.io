TCL's 10 Pro phone is nearly $70 off at Amazon for the first time since it released recently in May 2020. You can pick one up for $382 (normally $450). You might not have realized that TCL makes smartphones, but this mid-range device actually compares favorably to the likes of Apple's new iPhone SE and the Samsung Galaxy A51 in terms of build quality and, for the most part, specs. This device has a big 6.4-inch 1080p OLED screen with minimal bezels, an in-display fingerprint reader, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Inside, it features the Snapdragon 675 processor with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage with microSD card support. It'll work on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon carriers.
