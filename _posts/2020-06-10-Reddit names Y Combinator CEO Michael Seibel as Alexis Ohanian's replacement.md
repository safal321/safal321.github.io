Reddit has named Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel to its board of directors. In addition to running the well-known accelerator, Seibel also co-founded the live streaming company Justin.tv before it transformed into Twitch. Justin.tv was an early recipient of Y Combinator seed money through the accelerator's startup fund, as was Reddit. (Seibel also co-founded Socialcam and sold it to Autodesk in 2012.)
