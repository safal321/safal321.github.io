Fossil's new Gen 5E smartwatches are paired-down versions of last year's Gen 5 series, but they come in more sizes and at a more affordable price. As well as three new 44mm styles, the new Gen 5E is available in a new 42mm size, which features smaller bezels to maintain the same 1.19-inch OLED display. Both sizes of the Gen 5E will retail for $249, compared to the $295 starting price of the Gen 5.
