Staples is once again discounting Apple's AirPods Pro earbuds to $200, knocking $50 off the usual retail price from now until September 19th. The retail chain held a similar weeklong promotion in August, but inventory sold out within a day. Because this is the lowest price the earbuds have seen, this deal will likely sell out quickly.
