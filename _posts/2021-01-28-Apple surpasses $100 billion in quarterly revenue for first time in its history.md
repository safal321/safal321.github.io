Apple today reported its fiscal Q1 2021 earnings, which cover the final calendar quarter of 2020 and the holiday sales season. That means this is the first time we're getting a real indication of how the new iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max are faring with consumers. As it turns out, they're doing very well. Apple crossed $100 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the company's history: it brought in $111.4 billion in total, with earnings per share of $1.68.
