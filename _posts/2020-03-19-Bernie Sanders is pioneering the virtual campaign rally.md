The audience for Bernie Sanders' rally Monday night trickled in slowly, like it does for most of his music festival-like events.

Still, he had no trouble drawing a crowd on Monday night, as campaign surrogates made speeches lauding Sanders and his campaign's work. Neil Young delivered a solo guitar-and-harmonica set before introducing Sanders, who was prepared to speak to his supporters about the pandemic that's upending every inch of our daily lives.
