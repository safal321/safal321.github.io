Uber updated its app to let riders “discreetly” report instances that may not rise to the level of an emergency but still made them feel unsafe while on a trip. The examples that Uber gives include “harsh braking,” “inappropriate remarks,” or a driver who isn't paying attention to the road. But I'm sure many people who use Uber can come up with a litany of ways to use this new reporting feature.
