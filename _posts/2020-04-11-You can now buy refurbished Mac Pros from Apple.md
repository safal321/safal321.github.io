Apple's 2019 Mac Pro, the world's most expensive cheese grater — if you were going to use it for that, which you shouldn't — is now available on Apple's online refurb store, MacRumors reports. That means savings of around 15 percent, which is a ton when you consider the base price of a new Pro is $5,999.
