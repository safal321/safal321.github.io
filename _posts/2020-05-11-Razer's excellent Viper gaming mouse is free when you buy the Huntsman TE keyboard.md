Starting Sunday May 10th, Razer will host a promotion at Best Buy that bundles its Huntsman Tournament Edition wired gaming keyboard with the Razer Viper mouse. The keyboard alone costs $130, and that price will include the Viper (usually $80 by itself) for free with purchase. Just add the keyboard to your cart and the mouse will be added automatically.
