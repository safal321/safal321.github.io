Samsung is bringing a host of the Galaxy S20's new camera and software features to last year's Galaxy S10 and Note 10 lineups in a software update, the company announced today. The new features include camera functionality like Single Take and Night Hyperlapse, as well as new gallery and sharing features. Samsung didn't provide an exact date for the update's release, but said that it would be rolling out to select markets, including the US, “in the coming weeks.”
