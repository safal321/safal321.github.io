TCL has unveiled its latest Alto soundbars, which offer an affordable way of boosting a TV's built-in sound. With the exception of the $59 Alto 3, all of the soundbars are certified as being “Roku TV Ready.” This means they should integrate seamlessly with TVs running Roku's TV OS, allowing you to control and tune them with your TV's remote. TCL's Roku TV Ready soundbars range in price from $79 to $299.
