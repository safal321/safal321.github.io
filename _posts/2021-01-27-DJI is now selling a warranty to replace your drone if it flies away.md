DJI is now offering flyaway coverage for its Mini 2 and Mavic Air 2 drones, should they develop a mind of their own and take off. The cost of replacing the escaped drone is $225 for the Mini, and $399 for the Mavic, which is on top of the price of DJI's Care Refresh extended warranty. For that, you'll pay $50 for the Mini, and $80 for the Mavic. If you already own one of these drones and the extended warranty, you're eligible for flyway replacements going forward.
