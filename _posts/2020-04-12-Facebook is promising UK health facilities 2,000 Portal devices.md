UK health officials are partnering with Facebook to put Portal video calling displays in hospitals, care homes, and other facilities. Facebook will donate up to 2,050 Portals starting with a pilot program in Surrey and expanding to Manchester, Newcastle, London, and other areas. They're meant to let residents communicate with loved ones they can't see during the pandemic, while also to letting on-site employees coordinate with people who are working remotely and support telehealth efforts.
