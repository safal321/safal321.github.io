The pandemic is even affecting emoji. The Unicode Consortium, the group behind emoji releases, announced today that it's delaying its version planned for 2021, meaning that devices won't receive new emoji next year and instead will get a release in 2022. The good news is that the emoji that were announced earlier this year, like the olive, beaver, and plunger, will still be available this fall. Unicode says the delay is happening because it relies on volunteers who are currently overwhelmed dealing with the pandemic.
