Updated 9:35PM ET, January 30th: Just a few hours after we published this guide, Roku notified its users that it is pulling all seven of its Fox apps from its platform, and this includes Fox Sports. This means that your Roku device will be in the dark on gameday, unless you subscribe to fuboTV, Hulu with Live TV, or Sling TV to tune in (all of which offer a free trial).
