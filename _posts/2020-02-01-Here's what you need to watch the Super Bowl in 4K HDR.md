Updated 9:35PM ET, January 30th: Just a few hours after we published this guide, Roku notified its users that it is pulling all seven of its Fox apps from its platform, and this includes Fox Sports. So, your Roku device won't get the 4K HDR stream via the Fox Sports app, you can tune into the 1080p stream for free with the NFL app. Alternatively, you can subscribe to fuboTV, Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, or Sling TV to tune in (all of which offer a free trial).
