Unless you're willing to shell out for the Apple Magic Keyboard, Logitech's Folio Touch might be your best bet for turning your second-gen, 11-inch iPad Pro into a laptop. Right now, both Amazon and Best Buy are taking $30 off the well-regarded keyboard case, rendering it one of the best sales we've seen on the device in recent months. In addition to the dedicated trackpad and a fabric-like finish, Logitech's offering features like backlit keys, iPadOS integration, and more protection than you'll get from any of Apple's proprietary offerings. It's heavy, sure, but the added heft is a small price to pay when compared to the cost of a replacement screen.
