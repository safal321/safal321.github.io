Facebook has announced on Twitter that it will start testing a pop-up that asks users if they're sure they want to share an article that they haven't opened. The pop-up will prompt users to read the article, but they can also choose to continue sharing it if they want. A Facebook spokesperson said the test would be rolled out to 6 percent of Android users worldwide.
