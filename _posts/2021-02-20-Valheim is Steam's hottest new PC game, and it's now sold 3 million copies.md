The other day, I saw a game named Valheim atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Polygon seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn't ready to commit quite yet â€” I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? One million other people.
