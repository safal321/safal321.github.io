Instagram is making it easier to bring back deleted posts. The company is rolling out a “recently deleted” feature in the app that'll allow you to review content you've deleted, including photos, videos, reels, IGTV videos, and stories, and restore them. Instagram is positioning this feature as helpful against hacks, particularly if hackers gain control of an account and start deleting content. Starting today, users will need to confirm they're the account owner through either text or email in order to permanently delete or restore content.
