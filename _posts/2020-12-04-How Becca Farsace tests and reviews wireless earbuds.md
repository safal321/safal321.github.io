Wireless earbud reviews don't just happen. Three weeks ago, I got my hands on seven pairs of wireless earbuds to see which is the best option under $100. This might sound like Christmas Day for many, but the sight of such a pile on my desk for me spells ear pain and the inevitable feeling of needing to find new music to love or podcasts to be fascinated by. Don't get me wrong, I love my job but what no one told me about reviewing tech is it takes time and dedication.
