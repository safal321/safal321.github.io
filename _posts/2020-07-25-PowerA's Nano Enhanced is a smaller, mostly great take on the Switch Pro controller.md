Nintendo's Switch Pro controller is fantastic, but it's also kind of big. If you struggle to get a good grip on it or if you simply want a smaller controller to tuck into your bag, PowerA's new Nano Enhanced wireless controller for the Switch (also compatible with Windows 10) is a good solution. It's a more compact version that shaves about a third off the size of Nintendo's official controller. Most of its design and features are faithful, including USB-C charging, motion controls, and LED lights on its bottom to indicate connectivity status. On the downside, it lacks rumble support and NFC for Amiibo.
