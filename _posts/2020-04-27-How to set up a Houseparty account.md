Houseparty has become popular among teenagers and college students, mainly because it makes video chatting with friends quick and convenient. Houseparty shows you which of your friends is online; you can then open the app and join a call instantly. You can also play one of Houseparty's built-in games with friends when you're on a call together — in fact, Houseparty was acquired by Epic Games, known for creating Fortnite, last year.
