I've been waiting for the Surface Book 3 for two and a half years. Microsoft's 15-inch Surface Book 2 was largely just a refinement over the original model — released nearly five years ago — so I was really hoping the company was holding back some big changes for the Surface Book 3. Unfortunately, no big changes have arrived this time around. If you put it side by side with a Book 2, the Book 3 looks identical, and inside, there are a few modest upgrades that are expected in 2020: more powerful GPUs, the latest Intel processor, up to 32GB of RAM, and faster SSDs on some models.
