Apple's AirPods Pro truly wireless earbuds are $220 at Verizon, which is $30 off the usual $250 price. Most deals we see for this model usually range from $15 to $20, and saving this much is far less common. Compared to the standard AirPods, this model features active noise cancellation, improved sound, a wireless charging case, and a more customizable fit with ear tips. They will soon also feature Apple's new spatial audio feature for a more immersive sound experience. If you're an iPhone owner, my colleague Chris Welch thinks these are the best option available to you.
