If you're pining for the innocent days of 2017, when the biggest screw-up was the music festival meltdown known as Fyre Festival, you're in luck: you can now own a piece of merch from the disaster. The US Marshals Service is hosting an online auction for 126 items, including shirts, bracelets, tokens, and hats. The proceeds will go to a fund for the victims of the fraudulent fest, the Marshals Service says, and the auction runs through August 13th. Some items already have multiple bids, like a hoodie that's going for $130.
