Slack surprised Microsoft with a competition complaint in Europe yesterday. After arguing for months that Microsoft Teams isn't a true competitor to Slack and is more akin to Zoom, Slack finally admitted what was clear all along: Microsoft Teams is a competitor, and Slack is finding it hard to compete with Microsoft. It's not a surprising admission, but if Slack is finding it hard to compete with Microsoft, then it's going to face even greater headaches once Google finally gets its act together. After fumbling with communications apps for years, there are early signs that Google is now ready to take on Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.
