Lots of objects look good stuffed into a pair of Crocs. Strange things you wouldn't expect, like mini plastic bowls of ramen, beaded butterflies, or, like in Jillian Maddocks' case, a pile of pistachio green foam with a cherry on top. Maddocks started selling her take on Jibbitz, a Crocs-specific word for charms that stick into the shoes' holes for decoration, as part of her 323 apparel line. She repurposed materials she already had lying around — foam she uses to make headbands, fake cherries, and seashells — and ended up designing charms that make the Crocs look like a wearable sundae.
