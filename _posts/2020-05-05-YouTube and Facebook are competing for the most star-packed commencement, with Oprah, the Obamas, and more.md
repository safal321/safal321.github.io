YouTube is hosting an online graduation event to give seniors whose ceremonies have been canceled something to tune into. The company announced today that it's put together an impressive lineup of commencement speakers: President Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, K-pop sensation BTS, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Malala Yousafzai, and Lady Gaga are all on the list to speak, among others. There will also be “special appearances” from Alicia Keys, Kelly Rowland, Kerry Washington, Zendaya, and YouTube creators like Dude Perfect and The Try Guys.
