Comcast is announcing a new version of its hexagon-shaped xFi Pods, the mesh Wi-Fi extender pods it sells to extend Wi-Fi networks around your house, with more Wi-Fi bandwidth (up to 500Mbps, which it says is twice as fast) and a second wired Ethernet port on each pod as well. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge's parent company.) The company originally began selling its Wi-Fi extender pods to consumers in 2018 in packs of three or six plugs, but the new ones come in packs of one or two.
