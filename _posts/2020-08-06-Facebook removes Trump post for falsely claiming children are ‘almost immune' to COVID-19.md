Facebook has removed a post posted by President Donald Trump's account for violations of its misinformation policy, the company confirmed to The Verge. The video posted was of a Trump interview with Fox News' Fox & Friends program, in which the president claimed children are “almost immune” to COVID-19, which is false. The interview also included Trump saying COVID-19 “is going to go away,” and that his view is that “schools should open” because “this it will go away like things go away.”
