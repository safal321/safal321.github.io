If you've found yourself wanting some peace and quiet, whether it's from the upstairs neighbor's kid stomping around above you or just to silence other distractions, today's marquee deal has your name written all over it. The Sony WH-1000XM4 are $72 off at Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers â€” matching the lowest price yet that we've seen happen a few times now. We first saw this price drop occur during Prime Day last October, and it went on to become one of the most popular deals of 2020.
