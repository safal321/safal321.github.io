If you've been waiting for a deal on Amazon's new Echo Show 10 smart display that can spin around to always be facing you, today's your day. Normally $250, it's down to $210 right now for the black or white versions, both of which feature a camera for video chats, as well as for tracking you in order to make sure the screen's within view for convenience. This is the first price drop, and 16 percent off isn't bad.
