Ubisoft announced on Monday that its game subscription service, Ubisoft Plus, is adding support for Google Stadia, meaning any subscriber can sign up for a free Stadia account and stream Ubisoft games from the cloud on supported devices. Ubisoft first announced Stadia support in October when it rebranded from UPlay Plus into its current iteration, but the cloud gaming integration wasn't ready at the time.
