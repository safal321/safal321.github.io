Razer has announced a new version of its Wolverine wired controller that's made specifically for the Xbox Series X / S, with support for Xbox One and PC. It's called the Wolverine V2, and it has more enthusiast features than the pack-in controller that ships with Xbox consoles, like “mecha-tactile” switches under its face buttons, trigger stops for a customizable trigger feel, and a couple of macro buttons. It's a far cry from the versatility offered by Microsoft's Elite Series 2 controller, but it's considerably cheaper at $100. It's available starting today from Razer's site.
