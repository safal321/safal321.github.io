Ubisoft will let you redeem a free copy of open-world hacking simulator Watch Dogs 2 for PC right now just by logging in to your Uplay account. To snag your copy of the 2016 game, head to this page on Ubisoft's website where you'll be asked to log in. When you do, you'll see a message that you've successfully claimed the game and that it will soon show up in your Uplay library. It's unclear how long the giveaway will be going on, though, so you might want to jump on the deal sooner rather than later.
