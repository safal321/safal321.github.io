Today, Google shared a detailed timeline for Google Play Music's shutdown. Access will be revoked in September for users in New Zealand and South Africa and for users in all other regions in October. Come December, the service will shut down completely, after which you won't be able to transfer your content. Additionally, starting later this month Google will no longer accept purchases for music within its Play Store.
