If you've ever been frustrated by a road simply not existing on Google Maps, the company's now making it easier than ever to add it. Google will be updating its map editing experience to allow users to add missing roads and realign, rename or delete incorrect ones. It calls the experience “drawing,” but it's closer to using the line tool in Microsoft Paint.
