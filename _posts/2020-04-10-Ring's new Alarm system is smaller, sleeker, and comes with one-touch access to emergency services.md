Amazon-owned Ring today announced a second generation of its home security system that comes with a set of sleeker, smaller hardware. The updated keypad now has buttons for quick access to contacting emergency services, such as police, fire, or medical assistance. (You'll need to hold the button for three seconds before it begins calling those services.) The new motion and contact sensors are also slimmer, making them easier to blend into the corners and edges of your home. All hardware now comes in a matte finish; the previous version had a shiny, plasticky coating.
