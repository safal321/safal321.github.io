On Monday, I had a chance to talk with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the company's plans to build new audio products over the next few months. The occasion for our interview was the opening of Sidechannel, a Discord server I launched over the weekend with some fellow independent journalists. We didn't know what to expect when we opened the doors, but more than 2,500 people filed in over the first day, and many of them joined us for a lively conversation about Facebook's rapidly evolving attitudes toward creators.
