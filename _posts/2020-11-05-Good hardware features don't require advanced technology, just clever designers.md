Hello again, friends. The Processor newsletter is back after a not-so-brief hiatus caused by the absolutely frenetic pace of hardware reviews this fall and a special run of Vergecast podcast episodes about those reviews. I'm really proud of those podcasts and if you haven't caught them, I think it's worth going back to give them a listen.
