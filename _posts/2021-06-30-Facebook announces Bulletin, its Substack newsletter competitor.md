Facebook is getting into the subscription newsletter game. It's launching a new service today, called Bulletin, that allows writers to publish free and paid newsletters that can be posted to the web, sent to subscribers' inboxes, and shared across Facebook. Perhaps the biggest perk for now: Facebook says it won't take a fee from writers “at launch,” and writers retain full ownership of their work and subscriber list.
