Riot Games is closing an investigation into whether CEO Nicolo Laurent harassed or discriminated against former employee Sharon O'Donnell, saying it found “no evidence” of the claim. “After review of the results of the investigation,” Riot said in a statement, “there is no evidence that Nicolo harassed, discriminated, or retaliated against Ms. O'Donnell. The Special Committee has also expressed its full confidence in Nicolo's leadership, that no action against him is warranted, and that he will continue to operate as CEO.”
