The Apple AirPods Pro usually cost $250 new, but Best Buy has taken $55 off the cost for its refurbished units. You can snag a set for $195, and it includes the original accessories, like the Lightning to USB-C cable, a wireless charging case, and two sets of silicone ear tips. Apple originally included three sets of ear tips, but some reviewers note that Best Buy doesn't include the medium-sized ones.
