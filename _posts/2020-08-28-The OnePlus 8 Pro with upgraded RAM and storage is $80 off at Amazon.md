The OnePlus 8 Pro in the onyx black or ultramarine blue color variant is $80 off at Amazon right now. This discount brings the total down to $920. In case you missed it, some OnePlus phones aren't so cheap â€” even with a sizable discount like this one applied to it. Nevertheless, if you've been waiting for even a slight price drop on the unlocked model that features the Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of fast UFS 3.0 storage, this is your opportunity to save.
