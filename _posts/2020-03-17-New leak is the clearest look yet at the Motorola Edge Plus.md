Motorola's unannounced flagship, the Edge Plus, has leaked again, this time in a series of alleged press renders from Evan Blass. Given the amount of information that's already spilled about the handset there's not too much we can learn from the new images, but it confirms some previous details such as the 108-megapixel camera, curved hole-punch display, and 3.5mm headphone jack. From the new renders, it seems that the new handset will be available in red and blue.
