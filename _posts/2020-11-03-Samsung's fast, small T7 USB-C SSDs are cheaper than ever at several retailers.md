Samsung's pocket-sized T7 USB-C SSD is steeply discounted at a few retailers. The price cut applies to the 1TB and 2TB models, both of which could make for speedy external add-ons for the PS5 or Xbox Series X / S consoles, in addition to the more obvious use case of connecting it your PC. The 1TB SSD is down to $160 (usually $200). As far as the color options of the T7, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo have them in red, blue, or black. If you want to double the storage to 2TB, that version of the T7 is $250 (usually $370) at Amazon. That's a particularly good value.
