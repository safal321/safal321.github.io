Apple has launched three new products today, following their announcement just a few days ago at the company's “Time Flies” event. You can now order the $329 eighth-generation iPad, the $399 Apple Watch Series 6, and the $279 Apple Watch SE from its online store. The redesigned iPad Air with USB-C charging won't arrive until October.
