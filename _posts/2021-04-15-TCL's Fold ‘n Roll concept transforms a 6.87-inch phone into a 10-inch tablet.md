TCL is once again teasing a foldable phone concept — and it's a Frankenstein's monster of some previously showcased flexible concepts. Called Fold ‘n Roll, it combines the company's “dragonhinge” technology with an extendable display panel. The result is a 6.87-inch phone that can expand to an 8.85-inch phablet size or fully extend to a 10-inch tablet. Outside of that, the company isn't offering any other detailed information.
