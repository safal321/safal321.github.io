Let's face it: some of us are so busy these days — what with pandemics and presidential elections and attempted overthrows of the government — that we don't pay enough attention to what we are subscribed to (and paying for). Especially now, when there are more and more streaming services vying for our attention, it's easy to go for a trial subscription, or to decide that you're going to subscribe “just for a couple of months,” and then completely forget about it. Meanwhile, your charge card is being pinged every month.
