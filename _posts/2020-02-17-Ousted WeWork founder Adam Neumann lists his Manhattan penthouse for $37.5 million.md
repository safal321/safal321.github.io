The last chapter of the WeWork saga closed with our hero — its founder, Adam Neumann — being ousted from his company (with a payout of $1.7 billion) and loosed upon the world. Its next chapter opened with a question: is the business sustainable? The answer is still unclear. Employees across WeWork are organizing in the face of massive potential layoffs, as the company began to divest itself of its “non-core” business; they couldn't get T-Mobile chief John Legere as their new CEO. In the midst of all this wreckage, which is slowly burning out, we've had a few Neumann sightings of our own. He was last seen jetting off to Israel two days before Christmas.
