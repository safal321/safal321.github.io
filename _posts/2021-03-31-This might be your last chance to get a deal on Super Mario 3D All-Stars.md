As it promised, Nintendo will pull Super Mario 3D All-Stars, the Switch compilation featuring Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy, from shelves at the end of the day â€” both digital and physical. This final day in March 2021 is your last chance to get the game digitally on your Nintendo Switch, and it could be the last day you'll be able to find it in cartridge form (that is, without spending more than the retail asking price of $60).
