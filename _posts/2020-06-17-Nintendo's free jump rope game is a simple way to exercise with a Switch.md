Jump Rope Challenge is a charming new free game from Nintendo that uses a pair of Joy-Cons to jump a virtual rope. You hold the Joy-Cons as though they're jump-rope handles, and swing them around as you jump. Jumping bunny rabbits show your progress on-screen. The initial aim is to do one hundred jumps a day, although this goal can be increased.
