Apple plans to release a new iPad mini featuring “the biggest redesign in [its] nine-year history” this fall, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports (via 9to5Mac). The new device is expected to feature slimmer bezels, a larger display, faster performance, and a design similar to Apple's new iPad Air from last year, MacRumors notes. It could be a big shakeup for Apple's smallest tablet, whose design has remained remarkably consistent since its debut in 2012.
