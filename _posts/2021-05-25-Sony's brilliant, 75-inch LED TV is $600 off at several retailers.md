If you're looking for a behemoth 4K TV with impressive motion handling, solid black levels, and vibrant colors right out of the box, it's hard to go wrong with the Sony X950H series. Sony's 75-inch HDR display is not cheap at $2,600, however, Best Buy, Amazon, and BuyDig are all currently offering the TV for $600 off the initial list price, bringing it down to $2,000. The X950H model also sports four HDMI ports, compatibility with both Alexa and Google Assistant, and a host of Android TV features. It's one of the best deals we've seen on Sony's premium LED in recent months, especially when you consider that BuyDig is throwing in a $100 Visa gift card with each purchase.
