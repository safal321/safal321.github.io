The Atari arcade cabinet game Race Drivin' was ported to the Atari ST in the summer of 1991, and then ported again to the SNES a year later. It was the sequel to 1989's Hard Drivin', and while it boasted numerous improvements over its predecessor — it could model a car with four wheels, as opposed to Hard Drivin's two — it was still not particularly fast.
