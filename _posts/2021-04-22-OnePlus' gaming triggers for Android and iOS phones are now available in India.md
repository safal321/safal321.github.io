OnePlus CEO Pete Lau tweeted pictures of some attachable gaming triggers the company has created, and they're made for more than just OnePlus' phones. SlashGear and Android Headlines noticed them being teased during the unveiling of the OnePlus 9 back in late March, but they're available online now in India from the OnePlus site for 1,099 rupees, which converts to roughly $15. OnePlus hasn't confirmed that these gaming triggers will be releasing globally, and the company wouldn't comment on pricing and availability when I reached out.
