Logitech announced its new G335 wired gaming headset that's available for preorder now at $69.99. It's expected to ship in July. The G335 borrows several design elements from the $129.99 G733 wireless model released in 2020, including its expressive color options (as well as a new mint colorway), the comfortable bungee headband, breathable ear pads, a volume dial built into the right ear cup, and a flip-to-mute microphone.
