The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 will soon be two years old, but it's still a great phone â€” especially at the $499 price Amazon is selling it for today. This is the best deal we've seen yet, and it's far lower than its $1,000 retail price (though these days, it usually runs you about $600 or more depending on the color). This sale is specifically on the lavender color option with 128GB of storage. If that's not your favorite color, you can slap a case on it. And if it's not enough storage for you, you can put up to a 512GB microSD card in it to expand the available capacity. (Note: 200GB microSD cards are cheaper than usual at Amazon today at $27.)
