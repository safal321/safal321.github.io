iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, Apple's newest software updates for the iPhone and iPad, are rolling out now, and they bring a lot of new features. On iOS 14, you'll be able to add widgets to your home screen, watch video in picture-in-picture mode, and use a new Apple-made language translation app. On iPadOS 14, you'll be able to handwrite into text boxes and use a redesigned search experience. And both software updates offer improvements to Maps, Messages, Safari, and Siri.
