Last month, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending guest worker visas, like the H-1B, which is widely used by tech companies to attract talent from other countries without needing to go through the traditional immigration process. Competition for the visas is high since the US only issues 85,000 per year and means a foreign worker's employment status affects their immigration status. Tech companies in Silicon Valley have protested the administration's policies; Twitter called the policy “damaging,” and Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was “deeply disappointed” by the ban.
