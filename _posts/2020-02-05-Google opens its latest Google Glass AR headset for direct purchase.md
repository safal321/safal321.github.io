Google is making its latest augmented reality headset, Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2, available for direct purchase, nearly a year after launching it through select workplace partners for $999 a unit. The price remains the same (or slightly more if you get the Glass “pod” attached to a band), but Google says you no longer have to go through a “solution provider” to purchase one.
