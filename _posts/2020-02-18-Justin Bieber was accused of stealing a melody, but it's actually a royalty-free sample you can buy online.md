Justin Bieber recently dropped his latest album, Changes, and it took less than 24 hours before the pop star was accused of stealing the melody used in one of its songs. Indie artist Asher Monroe pointed out that the soft and plucky hook in his 2019 song “Synergy” is the same as the one in Bieber's “Running Over.” However, it turned out no one stole anything because the melody isn't by either artist. It's a royalty-free sample by producer Laxcity that can be purchased from online sounds marketplace Splice.com.
