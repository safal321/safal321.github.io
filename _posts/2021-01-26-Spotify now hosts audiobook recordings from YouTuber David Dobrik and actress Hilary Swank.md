Spotify isn't limiting its audio ambitions to podcasts and music. Today the company announced it's furthering its audiobook experiments with the release of nine new audiobooks available exclusively in the app. As first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, among the works, which are all part of the public domain, are David Dobrik narrating Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; Forest Whitaker reading Frederick Douglass' memoir Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave; and Hilary Swank narrating Kate Chopin's The Awakening. It's also releasing an accompanying audio series called Sitting with the Classics on Spotify, a show in which Harvard professor Glenda Carpio explains the stories' histories and narratives for a modern listenership.
