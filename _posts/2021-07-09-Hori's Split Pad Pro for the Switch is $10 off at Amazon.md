The deals are thin today, but there are a few that are worth sharing with you. If you already have a Switch or are planning to get the OLED model launching in October, you'll definitely want to get Hori's Split Pad Pro controllers. You can get them in the translucent black colorway (in my opinion, the best option available) for $40 at Amazon, which is $10 off their normal price. These slide in just like Joy-Con controllers but are more accommodating for larger hands than Nintendo's. They make the Switch less portable, but it might be worth it for you. Unlike Joy-Con, though, these don't feature rumble, and they only work while connected to the Switch.
