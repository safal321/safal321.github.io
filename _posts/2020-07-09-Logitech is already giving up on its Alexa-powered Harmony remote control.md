Logitech's Harmony brand tried to reinvent the wheel with its Harmony Express remote control, and it didn't work. The company just sent out an email to customers alerting them that the $250 remote — which used Amazon's Alexa voice assistant as the brains for controlling your various home theater components — will cease functioning after September 30th. It will be fully cut off from both the Harmony and Alexa clouds, according to this FAQ. Ouch.
