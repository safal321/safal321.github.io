One upon a time, if you had more than one Twitter account and wanted to switch from one to the other, you had two choices: you could either go through the boring exercise of logging out of one and logging into the other, or you could use a Twitter client like TweetDeck or Hootsuite. TweetDeck is still around (as is Hootsuite, although it no longer has a free version), but you can now use Twitter's native app on the web or a mobile device to easily switch from one account to another, for up to five different accounts.
