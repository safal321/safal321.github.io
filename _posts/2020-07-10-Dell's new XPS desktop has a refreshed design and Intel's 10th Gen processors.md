Dell has given a facelift to its XPS desktop, resulting in a smaller and far more appealing chassis than the previous iteration. The biggest changes are easy to spot, including making half of the case's front just a big air intake to keep it cool. Dell also realigned the front I/O panel consisting of three USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 ports, one USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 port, a headphone jack, and an SD card slot along its right side. And as modern as it all looks, it still includes a good old disc drive with the option to upgrade to a Blu-ray burner.
