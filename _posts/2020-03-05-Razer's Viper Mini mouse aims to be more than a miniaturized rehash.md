Last summer, Razer's Viper wired gaming mouse had the distinction of being the company's most lightweight mouse yet. Now Razer has one-upped itself with an even lighter mouse called the Viper Mini, which weighs in at 61 grams (2.15 ounces). This may not be a lot different from the 69-gram (2.43-ounce) Viper, but it's just a little closer to feeling completely weightless, if that's your bag.
