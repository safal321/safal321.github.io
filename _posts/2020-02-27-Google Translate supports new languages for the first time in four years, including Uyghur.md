Google Translate is adding support for five new languages today, bringing its total to 108 languages. The move marks the first addition of new languages to Google's artificial intelligence-powered translation product in four years, the company says. Among the new languages added are Kinyarwanda, Odia, Tatar, Turkmen, and Uyghur, and Google says the collective speaking population of all five combined is about 75 million people around the globe.
