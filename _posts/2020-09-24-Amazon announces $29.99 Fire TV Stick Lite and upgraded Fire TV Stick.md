Amazon has announced its latest video streaming devices for the TV: today, the company introduced an upgraded, more powerful Fire TV Stick for the same $39.99 price. But Amazon is getting even more aggressive on price with the launch of the new Fire TV Stick Lite at just $29.99, which it claims is the “most powerful” streaming device for under $30. Both are capable of HD-quality streaming; the regular Stick can output expanded HDR color, but the Lite version cannot. Both will be released on September 30th.
