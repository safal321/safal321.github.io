Facebook published new recommendations for group admins yesterday evening in an attempt to help them facilitate conversations about race and inequality. Groups, which are essential to Facebook's business strategy, have struggled to moderate discussions about the Black Lives Matter movement and injustice in the US, with many admins and moderators deleting posts they consider “political.”  The deletion decisions prompted members to leave groups they'd been in for years, argue with each other, form splinter groups, and sometimes temporarily shut the groups down entirely.
