The 2020 versions of the MacBook Air and the iPad Pro don't release until tomorrow, March 25th, but you save $50 on either device right now at Amazon (via 9to5Toys). It's not common to get a deal on unreleased tech, especially Apple products, so it's possible that this discount will get yanked once they launch tomorrow.
