You're looking at the first images of the next speaker from Sonos. Set to be priced at $169, the new device — it's called the Sonos Roam — is much smaller than the Sonos Move, which was the company's first foray into portable speakers. This product has a much closer resemblance to popular, take-anywhere Bluetooth speakers like the UE Boom.
