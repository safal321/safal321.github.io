HP's redesigned 15.6-inch Omen gaming laptop is $300 off at Best Buy when you're signed in with a free account. This configuration is normally $1,450, but it's $1,150 until August 23rd when you click the “Apply Offer” box under the sale price. This machine released just a few months ago, and for this low price, it offers probably the best bang for your buck that I've seen in a laptop recently. It has Intel's Core i7-10750H six-core CPU, Nvidia's RTX 2060 graphics chip, a 1080p display with a super-fast 300Hz refresh rate display, 16GB of RAM, and finally, a 512GB NVMe SSD. Oh, and it has a Thunderbolt 3 port, so it really checks a lot of boxes from a value and performance perspective.
