HP's redesigned 15.6-inch Omen gaming laptop is $300 off at Best Buy when you're signed in with a free account and have student deals activated (it also helps to refresh the product page a few times if this box isn't showing up). This configuration is normally $1,450, but it's $1,150 until August 23rd when you click the “Apply Offer” box under the sale price. This machine released just a few months ago, and for this low price, it offers probably the best bang for your buck that I've seen in a laptop recently.
