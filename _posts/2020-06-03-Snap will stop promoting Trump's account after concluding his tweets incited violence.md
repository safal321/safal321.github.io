President Trump's verified Snapchat account will no longer be promoted within the app after executives concluded that his tweets over the weekend promoted violence, the company said today. His account, RealDonaldTrump, will remain on the platform and continue to appear on search results. But he will no longer appear in the app's Discover tab, which promotes news publishers, elected officials, celebrities, and influencers.
