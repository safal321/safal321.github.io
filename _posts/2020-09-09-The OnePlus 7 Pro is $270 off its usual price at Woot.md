The OnePlus 7 Pro is $430 at Woot, which is $270 off of its usual $699 price. This is a steal, coming in at $20 less than the previous best deal we've seen. It's worth noting that this is the GSM model of the phone, and it will work if you pop in a SIM card from Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, or any other GSM carrier, like Cricket, Google Fi, and others. It doesn't support 5G service, though.
