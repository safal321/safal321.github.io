Recently, some of the most popular webcams have been difficult to buy at major online retailers as people bought them to help stay in contact while social distancing or working from home during the pandemic. For example, as of this writing, Logitech's popular C920 HD Pro webcam is sold out on Logitech's US online store, and its listed price on Amazon US is currently well above Logitech's own $79.99 asking price. Other models are available, but the situation means you might not get the exact webcam you want.
