Dreams is a game about creating games. And not just games, but music, animation, and art, all through powerful creation tools provided by developers Media Molecule. Players have created hyperrealistic breakfast food and 90-minute detective games during the seven-month early access period, and a community emerged to teach one another tricks they'd discovered or showcase amazing creations they'd found. There's just one big hitch: there's no way to fully release a Dreams game (confusingly called a “dream”) outside of the tool in which it was made.
