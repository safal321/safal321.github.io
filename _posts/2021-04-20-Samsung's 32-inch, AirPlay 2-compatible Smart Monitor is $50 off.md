If you aren't sure whether a TV or computer monitor will suit your needs better, why not get a display that's a little of both? Samsung's 32-inch 1080p Smart Monitor M5 looks like a monitor with its small bezels and stand, but it has access to TV streaming apps, including Netflix, YouTube, Apple TV, and more without the need for extra hardware. The reason I'm sharing this info today is because it's $50 off at Amazon, down to $230 (via 9to5Toys).
