Today marks the release of Android 11's second public beta, the latest test version of the operating system that's officially due to release in the third quarter of this year. With this latest update, Google says it has achieved its new “Platform Stability” milestone — meaning, from the perspective of app developers, the operating system shouldn't change much between now and its final release. Google hasn't announced any new user features as part of its latest beta.
