If you're someone who hates the minimalist approach Apple has taken to its latest Siri TV remote, then this $30 replacement might be worth a look. The “Button Remote for Apple TV,” as it's been branded by its seller Function, looks almost identical to a version developed by Swiss TV and internet provider Salt that we covered last year. The biggest difference is that it should be easier to get your hands on it in the US, unlike the Salt-branded model, which AppleInsider notes currently commands a hefty premium on eBay.
