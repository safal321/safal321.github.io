Several PC components and gaming accessories are discounted today at Best Buy. Whether you are piecing together your next PC build or just want a few things to complete your setup, these deals might be what you're looking for. First off, the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless gaming headset is down to $60 ($40 off) when you buy it with at least $10 worth of Fortnite V-Bucks in-game currency. The lowest price we'd seen before was $80, and with this combo deal, you're looking at a total of $70 alongside the V-Bucks. Just add both products to your cart to see the price fall.
