The latest gadget from Satechi is both a stand and a USB-C hub made for the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models that have a USB-C charging port, as well as the 2020 iPad Air. It's $100, and with your tablet wedged into the stand, it should look more like a traditional monitor, so you can keep on pretending it's an actual desktop replacement.
