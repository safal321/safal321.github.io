Huawei has announced its first smartwatches running its own HarmonyOS operating system, the Huawei Watch 3 and Huawei Watch 3 Pro. In theory, it's the third separate operating system Huawei has used for its smartwatches, which originally ran Google's Android Wear (now Wear) before introducing its own LiteOS software with more recent devices.
