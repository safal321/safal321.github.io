Accessing the plethora of settings hidden in Gmail can be a pain, but it's about to get a little easier. Google is rolling out a quick settings menu, which offers a sampling of options that let you adjust the look of your inbox without leaving the page. Once this new tweak arrives on your account, it will activate automatically, and you won't have to leave the page to see the visual changes you make to your inbox.
