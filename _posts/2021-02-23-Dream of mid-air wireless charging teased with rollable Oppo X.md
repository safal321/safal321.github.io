Oppo has teased a new wireless charging solution that appears to work when a phone is held as much as a foot above a charging pad. The company has shown off the tech in a 30-second clip on its Weibo page to coincide with MWC Shanghai. The clip shows the Oppo X 2021 rollable concept phone, announced in November, charging above the pad, even when held at an angle.
