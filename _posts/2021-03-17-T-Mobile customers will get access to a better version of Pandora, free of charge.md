T-Mobile has announced a new perk for its customers: a year of access to a version of Pandora with ad-free stations on weekends, along with a few other benefits, at no extra cost. This is not to be confused with Pandora's paid premium service, but rather a version of the free service with a handful of extras. It starts on March 23rd as part of the company's T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion, which is included on most postpaid plans.
