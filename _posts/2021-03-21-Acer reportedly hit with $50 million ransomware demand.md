A hacking group is demanding $50 million from Acer, Bleeping Computer reported, in what appears to be one of the biggest ransomware demands to date. According to Bleeping Computer, the attackers may have gained access to the Taiwanese computer manufacturer's network via a Microsoft Exchange vulnerability.
