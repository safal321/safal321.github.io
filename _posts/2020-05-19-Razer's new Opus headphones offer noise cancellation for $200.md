Razer is usually known for its PC gaming accessories, but it's sidestepping expectations with today's announcement of the Opus wireless noise-canceling headphones. For $200, the Opus come awfully close to matching the features I've come to expect from headphones that cost nearly twice as much, like Sony's WH-1000XM3s or the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. In addition to having noise cancellation, these can automatically pause your music when they've been removed.
