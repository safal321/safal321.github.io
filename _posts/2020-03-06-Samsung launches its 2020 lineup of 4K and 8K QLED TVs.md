Samsung is officially launching its 2020 TV lineup today, with more 8K models than in years past — including the flagship Q950TS series with barely-there bezels. That “infinity screen” got all the attention back at CES, and Samsung says “when consumers watch from the average viewing distance of 10 to 15 feet, the bezels seem to disappear, creating an effect where the screen appears to elegantly float in the air.” But it's the 4K TVs that will matter more to most consumers shopping for a new set this year — especially if they're also planning to pick up an Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.
