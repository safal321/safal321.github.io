The JBL SA750 is a new stereo amplifier pairing modern streaming technologies like Airplay 2 and Google Chromecast with a design that wouldn't look out of place in a hi-fi rack from the ‘60s or ‘70s. It's got a set of reassuringly chunky-looking dials and switches as physical controls, an understated display, and its sides are covered with wood veneers. The amplifier, whose release coincides with JBL's 75th anniversary, will cost $3,000 when it goes on sale beginning this May.
