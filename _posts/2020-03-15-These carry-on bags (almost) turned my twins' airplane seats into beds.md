My husband and I have flown with our twin sons since they were infants. I've breastfed them next to a couple of middle-aged men who were on their way to a golf vacation. They've slept cradled in our arms, across our laps, and against our chests, La-Z-Boy style, as we've crisscrossed the country. Whatever the position, I'm not sure any of us were ever really comfortable â€” especially those two golfers.
