Apple has officially announced its 2020 flagship iPhones: the $999 iPhone 12 Pro and $1,099 12 Pro Max, featuring support for 5G and a new squared-off design that's reminiscent of the iPhone 4. It's also the first major redesign for Apple's full-screen smartphones since it introduced the bezel-less design with the iPhone X in 2017.
