Peak Design, makers of one of The Verge's favorite backpacks, has a new magnetic modular mounting system for your Apple or Samsung phone. The company's launching a Kickstarter today with the intent to ship an entire range of accessories starting next May, including bike mounts, car mounts, wall mounts, motorcycle mounts, wireless chargers, even a sleek mobile tripod that folds up small enough to palm.
