When we reviewed the $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070, we called it the 1440p sweet spot. At that resolution, you don't have to compromise on a single graphical setting in your games, similar to how the bigger $699 RTX 3080 doesn't make you compromise at 4K. But today, we're taking another look at the 3070 alongside its new competitor, the $579 AMD Radeon RX 6800 â€” because if you are willing to compromise, these two cards could transform your existing rig into a decent 4K machine.
