It's not very often that a notable new electric bike brand emerges from Amsterdam, the bicycling capital of the world. The last time was when VanMoof launched the Electrified S back in 2016. So it's with particular interest that I've been following the launch of the Veloretti Ivy and Ace e-bikes that begin mass production today. And I'm not alone in my anticipation as their first electrics begin shipping to customers.
