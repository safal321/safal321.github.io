The Google Pixel 3 was one of the best Android phones of 2018, and though it might not be the showstopper it once was, it's a standout if you can find it for the right price. Thankfully, if you're looking to upgrade or take the plunge into the Android ecosystem, Woot is currently offering a 64GB, unlocked version of the Pixel 3 for $160 â€” a discount of $240.
