Hulu is bringing its live TV service, which is separate from its standalone on-demand streaming app, to PlayStation 4 consoles now that Sony's competing PlayStation Vue pay-TV service has been shut down. Hulu + Live TV, as it's called, is a $54.99-a-month bundle that includes live television broadcasts from a number of channels in addition to an ad-free standard Hulu subscription. You can also pay extra for additional channel options.
