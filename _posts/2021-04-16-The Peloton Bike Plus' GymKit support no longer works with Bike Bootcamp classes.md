Peloton debuted its Bike Plus with a much-desired feature: GymKit support. But now, the company's pulling back some of that functionality. A Peloton spokesperson confirmed to The Verge today that GymKit no longer works with Bike Bootcamp classes and instead will “only be available in cycling classes for now.” The spokesperson also said: “Peloton is committed to bringing the GymKit integration to all workouts and disciplines within Apple's terms of service,” seemingly suggesting bootcamp workouts didn't fall under those terms.
