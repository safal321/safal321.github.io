Revel has announced it'll be resuming its electric moped service in New York City starting today, with new protective measures for riders like a mandatory in-app safety test and a requirement that all riders take a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before they'll be allowed to ride. The company worked with the City of New York in developing the new safety measures, and city officials have signed off on the new plan.
