Apple has announced iPadOS 14, a new version of its operating system for the iPad that comes with a focus on improving app designs to take advantage of the tablet's large screen. Many of Apple's apps have seen design changes. Photos and Music now have a sidebar that lets you jump between different sections of the app, and Calendar now has more controls on the top of the screen. The changes aren't dramatic, but they should make the apps easier to quickly move around and control.
