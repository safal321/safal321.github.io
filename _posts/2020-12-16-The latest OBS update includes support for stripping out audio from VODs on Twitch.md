The new Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) update is out, and as per usual it includes a bunch of changes and fixes that will make your streaming life just a little bit better. The biggest change in this version of OBS is support for the feature that Twitch debuted in Twitch Soundtrack â€” the ability to play music in a second track while you're streaming to Twitch, so that it can be stripped out of your recorded broadcast, or VOD (video on demand).
