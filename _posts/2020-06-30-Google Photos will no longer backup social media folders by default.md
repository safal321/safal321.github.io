Google Photos will no longer backup images and videos saved from folders created and managed by social media apps by default (via Android Police). Previously, Google's photo backup platform would automatically upload all images saved to your Android or iOS device, including those files stored in folders created by apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Now, Google says that feature is turned off, and you'll have to toggle it on for specific apps or run manual backups on specific folders.
