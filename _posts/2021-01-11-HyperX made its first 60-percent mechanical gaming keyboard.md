Most major gaming peripheral companies have already introduced 60-percent mechanical keyboards, which are more compact than full-sized versions and have become trendy in recent years for aesthetic and size reasons. But at CES 2021, HyperX is finally following suit by debuting its first compact model called the Alloy Origins 60. There are fewer keys here than one of its full-sized options, but not necessarily fewer functions; you'll find most of the keys available have secondary functions that can be activated by holding down the function button.
