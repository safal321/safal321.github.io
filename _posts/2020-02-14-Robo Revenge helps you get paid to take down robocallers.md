Robolawyer startup DoNotPay is launching a new service called Robo Revenge designed to let you easily sue any US-based company that spams you with robocalls, Vice reports. The service gathers the robocaller's details and then helps you sue them for as much as $3,000. The service is live now on DoNotPay's website and in its app.
