As promised, Disney now gives subscribers of Disney Plus the option to watch over 19 seasons of The Simpsons in the show's original 4:3 aspect ratio. When the subscription streaming service first launched, it only presented The Simpsons in a remastered, 16:9 aspect ratio â€” and this resulted in audiences missing out on some visual gags that were near the top or bottom of the frame.
