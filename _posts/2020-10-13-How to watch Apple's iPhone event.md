If you were disappointed that no new phones were introduced at Apple's “Time Flies” event last month, you can rest easy — Apple plans to introduce a rumored four brand-new iPhones today. The new phones are said to have a new squared-off design, sizes ranging from 5.4 inches to 6.7 inches, and 5G, although we're not sure which phones and which types of 5G. And it is said that the phones will not come with chargers or earbuds — which may not be a problem if you're already overstocked with chargers and already have a decent personal audio device.
