In the pandemic we've had to shift our lives to be socially distant â€” we work remotely, we shop online, and we workout at home. Last year, I signed up for a virtual reality workout app called Supernatural, which runs on the Oculus Quest. Now my wife and I use our Quest 2 almost every day to work out in VR. It feels like we're leaving the house, the music is great, and the workouts are no joke.
