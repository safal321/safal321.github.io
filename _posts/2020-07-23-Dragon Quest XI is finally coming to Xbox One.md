Ever since its debut in 2018, Dragon Quest XI has slowly been spreading to other platforms. It's playable on the PC, PS4, and Switch — and now it's finally coming to the Xbox One. During its Xbox Series X showcase today, Microsoft revealed that the “definitive edition” of the role-playing game is launching on its console on December 4th. It'll also be available through Game Pass.
