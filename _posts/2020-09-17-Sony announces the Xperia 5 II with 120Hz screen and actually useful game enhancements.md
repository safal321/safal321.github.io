Sony is continuing its refresh of its smartphone line to focus on photography and video with the new Xperia 5 II. It's the smaller sibling of the very tall and weirdly expensive Xperia 1 II, and this newer phone betters it in several regards. It's cheaper, for one thing, going on sale on September 29th for $949. The other major improvement is that Sony has put in a high-refresh-rate 120Hz panel.
