Microsoft's Outlook email app for Windows is crashing at launch for a large number of users around the world. Office 365 business users are reporting that Outlook launches and then crashes immediately, seemingly after a recent update. “We're investigating whether a recently deployed update could be the source of this issue,” explains Microsoft in a Twitter status update. “As a workaround, users can utilize Outlook on the web or their mobile clients.”
