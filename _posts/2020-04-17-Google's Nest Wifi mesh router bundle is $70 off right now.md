Google's Nest Wifi mesh routers and extenders have been discounted plenty of times since they launched last year, but Bed Bath & Beyond (originally via Slickdeals) might have the best deal yet. It's offering a deal on a bundle that contains one Nest Wifi router and one Nest Wifi point. This kit usually costs $269, but you can get it right now for $199.
