The OnePlus Nord line of smartphones will debut in the US on January 15th with two cheaper, midrange entries: the Nord N10 5G and the N100. You can preorder both phones from a variety of retailers ahead of release, but if you decide to buy either directly from OnePlus, the company will throw in a pair of wireless earbuds for free.
