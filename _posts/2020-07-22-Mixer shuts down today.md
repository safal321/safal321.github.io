As I write this, the top channel on Mixer right now is broadcasting a stream of Pokxc3xa9mon Yellow played by whoever's in chat — xc3xa1 la Twitch Plays Pokxc3xa9mon. It's titled “YouPlay presents: Mixer Doomsday party. Let's go one last time! (Day 19/19),” and there are 1,337 people watching. Just about every other stream on the site is titled similarly. It's mostly reruns of earlier streams exhorting viewers to follow broadcasters to Twitch and streamers who are AFK but broadcasting a game anyway. Even if its pulse hasn't stopped for good, Mixer is dead, with the site shutting down today per Microsoft's announcement in June.
