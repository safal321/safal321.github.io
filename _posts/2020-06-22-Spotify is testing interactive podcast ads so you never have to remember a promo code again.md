Spotify wants to ensure you never forget a podcast advertiser's promo code again. The company announced today that it's testing a new feature called “In-App Offers” that give podcasts the ability to keep an embedded link on their episode pages that, when tapped, leads to an advertiser's webpage. That webpage will automatically load with the promo code inserted. This way, people don't have to remember podcast ads' promo codes or go out of their way to find an advertiser's website.
