9to5Mac's Michael Steeber noticed a interesting coincidence today: the company has temporarily closed every single retail store in California, many more across the US, both stores in Mexico, both stores in Brazil, and is about to close 16 additional stores across the UK. As Steeber points out, that's nearly 100 stores if we include ones it closed in Germany and the Netherlands last week, leaving nearly a fifth of the company's locations now closed worldwide.
