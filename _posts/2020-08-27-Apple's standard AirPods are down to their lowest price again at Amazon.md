If you use an iPhone and are looking for a reliable set of wireless earbuds that connect quickly, Apple's second-generation AirPods are back down to their lowest price at Amazon. Normally $159, they cost $129 right now. This model includes a wired charging case. Other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart are selling them for $139. $10 isn't a huge discount, but we thought you'd like to know that now is a good time to invest.
