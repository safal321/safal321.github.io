Huawei is updating its MateBook X Pro this year with a new green color option and Intel's 10th Gen processors. The design is identical to last year, with a 13.9-inch, 450 nit, edge-to-edge 3000 x 2000 pixel touchscreen; fingerprint scanner embedded in the power button; and 2.93-pound weight. It also still includes the pop-up webcam that's built into the keyboard.
