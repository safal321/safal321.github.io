Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US, is now free to stream on Audible. It's part of a series of initiatives launched by JK Rowling and friends to keep everyone entertained while they're cooped up at home. Better yet, it's the version narrated by Stephen Fry, which has previously been difficult to legally access in the US.
