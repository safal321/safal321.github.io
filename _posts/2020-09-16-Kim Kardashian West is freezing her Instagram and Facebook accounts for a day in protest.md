Kim Kardashian West — one of Instagram's most popular users — won't post to her account for 24 hours to protest Facebook. The reality TV star and mogul tweeted her plans to freeze both her Instagram and Facebook accounts tomorrow because she can't “sit by and stay silent while these platforms continue to allow the spreading of hate, propaganda and misinformation.” She's joining a planned week of action organized by Stop Hate For Profit, a coalition dedicated to holding social media companies “accountable for hate on their platforms.” Other celebrities, including Kate Hudson and Sacha Baron Cohen, will also participate.
