The Raspberry Pi Foundation has been on a roll this year with cool new hardware: there's the upgraded Raspberry Pi 4; the new Raspberry Pi camera; and my personal favorite: the Raspberry Pi 400, a keyboard that's actually a fully self-contained computer. Its latest product is a little more humble: a $5 fan and heatsink set that's designed to keep your Raspberry Pi 4 cool, even for the most demanding overclockers.
