Vilo is a new mesh Wi-Fi company that promises a three-device system that covers up to 4,500 square feet for just $59. That's much more affordable than the mesh Wi-Fi systems offered by more established brands like Eero, whose comparable system costs $199 for a three-pack. Vilo is also selling a single standalone router for $19, compared to $79 with Eero.
