The answer to whether you should buy the $239 OnePlus Nord N200 5G depends a lot on who your wireless carrier is. If you're on T-Mobile — and thanks to a generous trade-in offer and a carrier exclusive, you probably are if you're considering the N200 — then this is a fine, basic device that will allow you to take advantage of the company's good 5G network at a very low price. The N200 5G will only work on Verizon and AT&T's 4G networks, however, so if you're with either of those carriers, it's not your best option.
