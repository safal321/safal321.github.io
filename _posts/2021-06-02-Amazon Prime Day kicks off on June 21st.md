Amazon Prime Day, the company's annual shopping holiday, will take place on Monday, June 21st through June 22nd, the company officially announced today. The forthcoming summer dates mark a return to form; the retail giant has historically held its shopping extravaganza in mid-July but postponed last year's event until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In its most recent earnings report, Amazon previously confirmed this year's Prime Day would take place in Q2.
