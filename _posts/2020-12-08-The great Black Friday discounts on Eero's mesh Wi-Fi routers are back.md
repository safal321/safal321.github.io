I expected to see some once-expired Black Friday deals make their return before the holidays, and ta-da, that's what's happening today. We're just seeing a few comeback deals today from Best Buy and Amazon, but they're some of the best discounts from Black Friday. The shortlist includes Eero's multi-pack mesh Wi-Fi routers and Apple Watch models varying in price, size, and capabilities. Oh, and a little game called Cyberpunk 2077 releases this Thursday, and there are deals on that.
