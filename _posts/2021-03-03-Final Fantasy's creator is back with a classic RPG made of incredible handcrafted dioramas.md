Fantasian has everything you'd expect from a new Hironobu Sakaguchi experience. The creator of the Final Fantasy series is once again making a roleplaying game that takes place in a lush fantasy world, features turn-based combat, and centers on a globe-spanning quest. There's even a new soundtrack from famed composer — and frequent Sakaguchi collaborator — Nobuo Uematsu.
