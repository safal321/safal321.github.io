Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden will participate in tonight's Democratic debate in Washington, DC. It was originally scheduled to take place in Arizona, a state that, along with Ohio, Florida, and Illinois, will hold its Democratic primary election on Tuesday, March 17th. However, the debate was moved to the country's capital by the Democratic National Committee in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
