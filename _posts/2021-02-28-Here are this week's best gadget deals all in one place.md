This week's batch of deals runs the gamut of gadgets and games. Whether you're a music fan who's looking to outfit their tech repertoire with new headphones or a big, powerful Bluetooth speaker, or a gamer, this roundup is for you. There still aren't any deals on hard-to-find graphics cards, but the good news is at least AMD's powerful Zen 3 processors are in stock right now (but perhaps not for long).
