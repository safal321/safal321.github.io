Apple is planning to reintroduce scissor-switch keyboards to more laptops soon, according to generally accurate analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. New MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models are coming in the second quarter of 2020, Kuo says in a research note obtained by MacRumors. The move would follow a pattern set by last year's 16-inch MacBook Pro, which replaced the unpopular and unreliable butterfly switches with a more traditional “Magic Keyboard.”
