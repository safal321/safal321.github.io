PayPal announced a new fundraising service called “Generosity Network” that seems poised to take on GoFundMe, part of PayPal's continued expansion into financial services it's been missing until now. The service allows you to set up a fundraising page and process donations through PayPal's payment platform. Transaction fees are waived on donations made with credit and debit cards, but according to TechCrunch, PayPal does intend to charge eventually.
