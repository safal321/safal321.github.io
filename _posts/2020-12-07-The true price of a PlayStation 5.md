This past week I've been watching eBay, trying to decide if I should sell my PS5. I wouldn't dream of becoming a scalper, but it's getting hard to ignore just how much it's worth. My daughter and I had beaten Astro Bot and Miles Morales, so I thought I'd peek at the resale market. Wow, are they worth a lot!
