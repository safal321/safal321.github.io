The Justice Department's head of antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has recused himself from the department's investigation into Google over a conflict of interest, The New York Times is reporting. The conflict of interest reportedly stems from Delrahim's previous work as a lawyer, when in 2007 he was contracted to lobby on behalf of the search giant's acquisition of the adtech company DoubleClick.
