Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live, the bean-shaped true wireless earbuds that have leaked extensively over the past couple months, are now official. Priced at $169.99, they'll be sold alongside the more traditional $149.99 Galaxy Buds Plus as a step-up option with larger audio drivers and the addition of active noise cancellation. They'll be available starting August 6th in black, bronze (which looks more rose gold in certain light), and white.
