Think of all the moments when you've debated whether you really need to send an email right now. Maybe you're afraid you'll forget about it if you don't do it right then, or you're communicating with someone in a different time zone, or it's the middle of the night and you just remembered something, or you've just written an angry email and know that you may regret it an hour later. Whatever the case may be, think about scheduling that email for later instead.
