Last year's Galaxy Note 10 Plus was truly a thing of beauty, with an amazing screen and superlative industrial design. And, judging by some high-quality (and completely unofficial) renders of the Galaxy Note 20 Plus, it looks like Samsung won't be changing too much in 2020. The only major difference is a new, bulkier camera module on the rear of the device.
