There's a new iPad-related case in town from Pad & Quill: a case for Apple's newly released Magic Keyboard, which is itself a $350 case for your iPad Pro. It's called the Copertina, and it retails for $99.95. It looks a little bit like the hard cover of a book; it is made, apparently, from archival-quality buckram linen, which is also used in bookbinding. It is undeniably beautiful.
