Many Apple services were hit by outages Tuesday evening, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, and Apple Arcade, according to Apple's system status page. For a majority of the affected services, Apple vaguely said that “some users were affected,” though for AppleCare in iOS and Apple School Manager, Apple said “all users were affected.”
