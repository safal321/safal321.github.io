PC gaming is an expensive hobby, so I wouldn't blame you if you're trying to save some money here and there. To that end, if you're looking for a QHD gaming monitor that's affordable and loaded with features, Acer's Nitro XV272U might have your name on it. It costs $300 at Amazon right now, which is the cheapest you'll find it online. This isn't the first time it has seen this discount, but I always want to tell people about it when it resurfaces.
