Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined Twitter xe2x82xac450,000 (around $546,000) over a data breach it disclosed back in January 2019, the regulator announced today. The security flaw exposed some supposedly private tweets from the service's Android users for over four years. Twitter was found to have violated the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) because it failed to notify the regulator within 72 hours of discovering the breach, The Wall Street Journal reports.
