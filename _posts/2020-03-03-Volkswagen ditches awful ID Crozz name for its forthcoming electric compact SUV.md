Volkswagen's ID Crozz, which was first unveiled in concept form back in 2017, is growing up and shedding its awful name. The German automaker announced today that it is ditching the eye-rolling name given to the concept version — Crozz, as in crossover. Get it? — in favor of the more neutral-sounding “ID.4.” The eventual production version will squeeze 300 miles of range out of its battery. And most importantly, it will be a global car, sold in Europe, China, and the US.
