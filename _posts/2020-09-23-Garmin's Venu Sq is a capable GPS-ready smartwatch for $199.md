Garmin has announced the $199 Venu Sq and $249 Venu Sq Music Edition, two square-shaped watches with 1.3-inch (240 x 240) color LCD touchscreens protected by Gorilla Glass 3. These wearables offer many of the same features as Garmin's more expensive Venu smartwatch â€” for less. Both new models are available now through Garmin.com.
