The refurbished Kindle Oasis has sold out at Woot after about an hour of this post being live. Unfortunately, refurbished versions of the current model are a little over twice the cost of the $100 version this post originally highlighted, but it's an option if you need to buy today. One big perk is that the newer version has a display with an adjustable color temperature that might make reading a little easier on the eyes wherever you are.
