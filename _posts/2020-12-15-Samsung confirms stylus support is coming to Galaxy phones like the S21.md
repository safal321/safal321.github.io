Samsung's president of mobile, TM Roh, dropped several hints about the company's product roadmap in a blog post today. He confirmed Samsung will hold an event in January â€” presumably for the Galaxy S21. He also implied that S Pen support will come to more phones and that Samsung intends to broaden its line of folding phones with less expensive options.
