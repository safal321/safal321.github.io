Twitter has banned a group that appeared to leak years of records from 200 police departments. The platform removed the account of Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), a collective that recently published nearly 270 gigabytes of data under the title “BlueLeaks.” Twitter also added a warning page that appears if you click an existing link to the dataset, and it's blocking new tweets that include the link, warning that it's been identified as “potentially harmful.”
