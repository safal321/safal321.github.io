The PlayStation 5 offers backwards compatibility for the existing PlayStation 4 lineup of games, meaning you'll be able to play almost any PS4 game you already own on the new console. Some games will also offer the option to upgrade to a proper PS5-optimized next-gen title, like Cyberpunk 2077 or Spider-Man: Miles Morales.
