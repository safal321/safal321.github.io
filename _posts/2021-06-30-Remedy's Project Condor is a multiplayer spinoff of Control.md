Developer Remedy Entertainment announced that it's making a new game, codenamed “Condor,” a multiplayer spinoff of Control. No release date, price, or story beats have been shared for Project Condor, but all we know so far is that Remedy's press release says it will be a four-player cooperative PvE (player vs. environment) game. It'll be built with Northlight, the same engine used for Control. It will release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X / S consoles.
