If you've been hunting for a Thunderbolt 4 dock for your new laptop, Razer has a new option for you to consider, simply called the Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock. It's loaded with ports, and of course, Chroma RGB lighting, too. Razer says it's USB4 compliant, so it'll be compatible with the next wave of fast peripherals and devices. It's available for preorder through Razer for $329.99, which seems competitive for what it offers.
