Super Cruise, the hands-free driver assistance system from General Motors, is getting a major upgrade. An enhanced version of the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) will be introduced starting on the 2021 Cadillac CT5 and CT4, followed by the all-new 2021 Escalade, the automaker announced on Tuesday. Among the improvements will be an automated lane-change functionality, which enables the hands-free system to change lanes when conditions are appropriate.
