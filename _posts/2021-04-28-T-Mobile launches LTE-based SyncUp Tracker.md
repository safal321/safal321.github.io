It seems that 2021 is the year of the tracker, with new options from Samsung, Apple, and now T-Mobile in the form of its SyncUp Tracker. But unlike those other Tile-type tracking devices, SyncUp uses LTE rather than Bluetooth or Ultra Wideband for real-time location information, a la Samsung's SmartThings tracker. That means it doesn't rely on being within a certain range of your phone (or other phones) to tell you where it is â€” but it does come with a $5 per month data charge on your T-Mobile phone plan.
