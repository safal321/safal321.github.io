New research from a team of MIT engineers has found an alarming string of vulnerabilities  in a leading blockchain voting system called Voatz. After reverse-engineering Voatz's Android app, the researchers concluded that an attacker who compromised a voter's phone would able to observe, suppress, and alter votes nearly at will. Network attacks could also reveal where a given user was voting and potentially suppress votes in the process, the paper claims.
