Sony's WH-XB900N over-ear, wireless headphones are steeply discounted at Amazon. Normally $248, they're $100 off of that price, which is a big 40 percent discount. These headphones offer digital noise cancellation, and while that will help to make things a little quieter, it's likely not nearly as effective as active noise cancellation that, in the case of Sony's $350 flagship WH-1000XM4, relies on microphones, an algorithm, and dedicated processor to help hush the outside sound. But for the money, they should get the job done. They share a few similarities to Sony's flagship model, including their touch interface, USB-C charging, and they have the same attention mode that lets you hear what's happening around you by holding a hand over the right ear cup.
