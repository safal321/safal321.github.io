There's really not much of a resemblance between the webOS software that runs on LG TVs and the Palm smartphones where the operating system had its beginnings many years ago. But LG's TV interface has grown to be among my favorites for its efficiency at staying out of the way. When you hit the remote's home button, a shortcuts bar with apps, HDMI inputs, and other destinations slides up at the bottom of the screen but doesn't completely overtake whatever's on-screen. Highlight a streaming app, and an additional row slides up to reveal recommended picks and what's streaming.
