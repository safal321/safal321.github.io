I finished This is a Robbery, and I won't spoil the ending but if you're thinking there will be a huge reveal at the end, well, you might be disappointed. What I found interesting throughout the four-part series was how the storyline relied on the voices of newspaper reporters who have covered the heist —and its aftermath —over the years. Considering the filmmakers are Colin and Nick Barnicle, sons of longtime Boston Globe columnist and current MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle, it makes sense they'd center journalists in the story. Go watch it, Boston looks absolutely beautiful and the Boston accents are more authentic than anything else you'll watch this year. Plus, if you can figure out the central mystery of the series there's a $10 million reward in it for you.
