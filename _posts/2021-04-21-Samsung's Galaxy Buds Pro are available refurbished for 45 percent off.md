At Best Buy, you can get a refurbished set of the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro truly wireless earbuds for $110 today in the silver colorway. This model released just a few months ago alongside the Samsung Galaxy S21, and at most retailers they still sell for their original $200 price. The lowest price we've seen recently for a new set is $165, and that's bound to happen again at some point. But if you're all about saving money, this refurbished deal can't be beat. The Galaxy Buds Pro provide the “best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds,” according to audio expert and Verge reviewer Chris Welch.
