Snapchat is now allowing creators to publicize how many subscribers they have. This is the first time Snapchat has given its users any sort of public-facing metric about their followings or audiences, and it represents a substantial change to the platform, as first reported by Tubefilter. In a statement to The Verge, a Snap spokesperson said: “We've listened to feedback from our creator community and many of them expressed interest in having the option to show that their community on Snapchat is growing,” which is why it's making subscriber counts visible. Creators can decide to turn this feature on or off from their settings.
