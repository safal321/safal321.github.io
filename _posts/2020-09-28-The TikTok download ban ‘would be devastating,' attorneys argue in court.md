Attorneys for TikTok argued Sunday morning during a dial-in hearing that a ban by the Trump administration would be “devastating,” and urged a judge to block it until the entire case can be decided. TikTok's attorney said the ban that would prevent new downloads of TikTok from Apple and Google's app stores at 11:59PM ET today was essentially “shutting down speech.” But the government's lawyers argued that First Amendment claims by TikTok don't apply, because the Trump administration considers the app a national security risk.
