A group of tech platforms has announced a new initiative aimed at combating online child sexual abuse, CNBC reported. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter are all part of the 14-year-old Technology Coalition, which says its new Project Protect will enact a “five pillar” plan to put structure, membership models, and staffing in place to support the group's long-term goals.
