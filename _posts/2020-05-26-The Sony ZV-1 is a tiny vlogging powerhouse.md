Sony has officially announced the ZV-1, a compact camera designed specifically for shooting video. Even more specifically than that, it's designed for vlogging. It's based on essentially the same core as the popular RX100 point-and-shoot camera line, but optimized for video with a few features that will appeal to people who regularly need to shoot footage of themselves.
