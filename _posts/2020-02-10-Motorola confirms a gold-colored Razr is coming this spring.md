Motorola confirmed today that its much-hyped folding Razr is going to come in a second color: blush gold. The option will be available this spring. The color previously leaked last week, so we had a hunch that it might be coming. The Razr is currently only available in black on Verizon for $1,499, with new orders delivering by March 3rd. Motorola hasn't said how much the gold version will cost, but it's unlikely to tack on an added premium over the black option.
