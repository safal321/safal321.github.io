A new subscription service from Google Photos will print and mail you a selection of your photos each month, 9to5Google reports. The service's $7.99 monthly fee gets you 10 automatically-selected 4 x 6-inch prints, which are picked from the photos you've taken over the last 30 days. Google is currently trialing the service in the US, and you can sign up from a promotional banner that's appearing for some Google Photos users.
