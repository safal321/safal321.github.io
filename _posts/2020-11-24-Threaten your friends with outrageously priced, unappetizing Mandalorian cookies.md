In a recent episode of The Mandalorian, tiny puppet baby Yoda ate a blue cookie. I don't watch The Mandalorian, but I am online enough to have seen photos of the tiny puppet baby Yoda eating blue macarons. You can now buy these macarons, called “Nevarro Nummies” from Williams Sonoma. Haha cool! I love macarons hell yeah. Except that they cost $49.95 for a dozen.
