Sony has applied for a patent for its Back Button Attachment, the add-on accessory for the DualShock 4 announced back in 2019 that adds programmable buttons to the underside of the controller. The filing, spotted by IGN, doesn't call the device by its existing name, but rather describes the product as an add-on with buttons that “may be mapped to controller buttons using customized button mapping pre-sets” and features a number of diagrams showing off how it works.
