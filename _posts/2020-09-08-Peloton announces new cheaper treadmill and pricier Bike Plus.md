Peloton has doubled its product lineup, announcing a cheaper treadmill and more expensive exercise bike. The new treadmill, called the Tread, will be available for $2,495 starting in “early 2021,” while the exercise bike, the Bike Plus, will also sell for $2,495 from September 9th in the US, UK, Canada, and Germany. As a result of the launches, the original Peloton Tread has been renamed the Tread Plus ($4,295), while the original Bike keeps its name but has a lower price tag of $1,895.
