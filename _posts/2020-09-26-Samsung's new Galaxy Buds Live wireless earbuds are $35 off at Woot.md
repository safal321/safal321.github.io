Samsung's fantastic Galaxy Buds Live, lovingly referred to as “Galaxy Beans” due to their shape, are $35 off at Woot if you're an Amazon Prime member. This brings the cost from $170 down to $135 (just make sure you're signed in with your Prime account on Woot). If you aren't a Prime member, you can still get a great deal. It's $25 off, so $145 at checkout. These sale prices will last until later tonight, unless it sells out before then.
