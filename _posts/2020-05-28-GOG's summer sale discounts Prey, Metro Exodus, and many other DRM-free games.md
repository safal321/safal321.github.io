GOG.com has kicked off its summer sale on DRM-free PC games, filled with deals on new and old titles. This sale lasts until June 15th. A few of the highlights include Metro Exodus for $20 and Prey: Digital Deluxe Edition, which includes the base game, its soundtrack, and the Mooncrash DLC for just $12. Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition is $22.50, which is an excellent price for such a huge game (and it supports cross-save with the Nintendo Switch version of the game).
