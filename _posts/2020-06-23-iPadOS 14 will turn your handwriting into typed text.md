Apple announced iPadOS 14 today and with it comes multiple new features, including updates for the Apple Pencil. A new feature called Scribble makes handwriting on the iPad more seamless and powerful. If you write something with the Pencil in Notes, the iPad will be able to copy and paste that handwriting across apps. This means that text you wrote can be searched online or pasted in a document, and it'll be typed text instead of handwriting.
