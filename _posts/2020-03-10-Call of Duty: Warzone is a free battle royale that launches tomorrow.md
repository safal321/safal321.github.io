A new Call of Duty battle royale game is arriving tomorrow to compete with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite, and Apex Legends. Call of Duty: Warzone is a new free-to-play battle royale that will be available to play on March 10th with some unique twists. There have been many Warzone leaks in recent weeks, but the game is officially arriving tomorrow, and you won't even need Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to download and play since it's free for everyone.
