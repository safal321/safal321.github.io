SteelSeries has unveiled a fleet of Cyberpunk 2077-inspired gaming headsets as well as a lineup of themed accessories made for its Arctis Pro wired and wireless headsets. First up, though, is a headset that is actually brand-new to the company's lineup. It's the Arctis 1 Wireless for Xbox, and it follows a similar design and feature set as last year's excellent Arctis 1 Wireless.
