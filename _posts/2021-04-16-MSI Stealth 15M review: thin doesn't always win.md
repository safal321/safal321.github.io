MSI's Stealth 15M is a gaming laptop for people who'd prefer to keep their gaming habit a secret. The metal design looks striking, and, aside from the single-zone RGB backlit keyboard, there isn't much else about the 15M that'll give away what you're probably using it for â€” aside from its loud fans. Unless you're running the simplest tasks on battery saver mode, its fans are almost always audibly whirring, and the whining only gets louder with demanding applications and games. You might not notice it if you wear headphones or a headset most of the time, but others around you probably will.
