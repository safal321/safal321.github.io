AT&T has announced a partnership with Boingo Wireless to bring its fast mmWave 5G — which it calls 5G Plus — to more US airports, with a goal of seven by the end of the year and 25 by the end of 2022. That's counting its first deployment in Tampa International Airport earlier this year. There's a little bit of a catch, though; travelers will only find 5G Plus in certain areas of the airport, like major gates and concessions areas. Still, it's one place where range-limited but powerful mmWave might actually make sense. When else do you need to download an entire movie while you wait for your latte?
