You can pick up Vizio's 65-inch M-series (model M65Q7-H1) 4K TV for just $580 at Best Buy when you're signed in with a free My Best Buy account. Otherwise, it's $600. This model regularly costs $700, and today's offer is a good one considering its size and specs. Not many TVs at this price point are going to be worth your money, but this one stands out with a QLED panel that offers more accurate contrast and colors than a standard LED.
