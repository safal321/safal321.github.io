Apple is reportedly planning to launch a new 5.5-inch entry-level iPhone, according to evidence found in iOS 14 by 9to5Mac. It has been rumored for some time that Apple would soon release a new 4.7-inch LCD phone that reuses the iPhone 8 design with updated internals, but this is the first indication that Apple may release a “Plus” version — and given the apparent 5.5-inch screen size, this new phone will presumably reuse the iPhone 8 Plus' design.
