The PS5 is a strange-looking console, and its curved edges can make it difficult to know exactly which way the console should sit when it's laid down flat. In the significant majority of Sony's marketing, when the console is shown on its side, the disc drive is on the bottom. But rather hilariously, it seems that even Sony can get confused about which way it's supposed to go, as it released a video on its main Twitter account showing the console lying down with the disc drive on top (via Kotaku).
