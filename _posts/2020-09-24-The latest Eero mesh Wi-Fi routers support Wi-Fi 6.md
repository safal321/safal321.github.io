Amazon has debuted the $129.99 Eero 6 and the $229.99 Eero Pro 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers, along with the $89.99 Eero 6 extender that support Wi-Fi 6 and Zigbee. Following leaks from earlier in September, the Eero Pro 6 improves on its predecessor with support for Wi-Fi 6, which delivers faster speeds and support for more devices connected simultaneously. Similarly, the Pro 6 is a tri-band router that offers a single band for tech that connects via 2.4GHz and two bands for 5GHz to allow more devices to connect at the fastest speeds. The Eero 6 is a dual-band device.
