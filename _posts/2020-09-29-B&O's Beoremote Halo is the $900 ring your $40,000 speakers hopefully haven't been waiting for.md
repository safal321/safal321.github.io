Bang & Olufsen's Beoremote Halo is beautiful & expensive, but it's not totally clear why it's necessary, or what it actually... is. Here's what we do know: It costs $900, and is a round device with a rectangular touch screen that lets you control the Bang & Olufsen music system you obviously have in your home. And of course it looks sexy as hell because B&O doesn't do ugly.
