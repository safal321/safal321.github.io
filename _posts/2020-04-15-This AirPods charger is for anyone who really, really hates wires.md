Wire-haters of the world, rejoice! Satechi's latest wireless charger offers a completely cable-free way to charge your Apple AirPods. The small dock, or the “USB-C Wireless Charging Dock for Apple AirPods” to use its full name, is just big enough for the headphones' wireless charging case. It gets power via a built-in USB-C jack that lets you plug it directly into the side of a MacBook, iPad Pro, or other USB-C device.
