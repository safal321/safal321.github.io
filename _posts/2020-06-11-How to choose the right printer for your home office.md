The need for a home / office printer has increased as more of us are working or schooling from home. You could be a parent who needs to print out workbooks for your child. Or you may find that it's easier to make notes on a business report using a pen or pencil rather than a keyboard. Or you've suddenly discovered that a government office is demanding that you snail mail a form to them. Or your local office supply store, which you normally use for printing out occasional forms, is either still closed or not a comfortable place to visit.
