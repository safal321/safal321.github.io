The holidays are upon us, and we're just about to enter crunch time for gift-getting. If you haven't made your selections, it's possible that gifts might not get where they need to go on time â€” unless you pay for rush shipping or you take advantage of curbside pickup services. I know that's a lot of pressure, but if you're ready to make a few purchases for tech fans in your life, we have a few last-minute suggestions that also happen to be good deals. Depending on the retailer, these might not arrive in time for the holidays, but it's the thought that counts, right? You've got this!
