Facebook Gaming has announced a path to partnership for streamers in its Level Up creators program, which is the site's equivalent of Twitch's affiliates. It's pretty grueling, and eligibility isn't judged on the same metrics as its Level Up program, which allows streamers to start monetizing their broadcasts. Partners, however, get a slew of benefits, including a direct line to Facebook's support team, a private Facebook Gaming community group, partner-only invites to Facebook Gaming events, a partner badge, and more.
