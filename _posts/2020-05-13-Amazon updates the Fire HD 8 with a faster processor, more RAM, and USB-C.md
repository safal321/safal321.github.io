Amazon has announced a new update for its Fire HD 8 tablet, adding a faster processor, more RAM, and USB-C charging. These are all welcome updates for the 8-inch tablet, which hasn't seen a meaningful update in years. There's also a new Fire HD 8 Plus model, which offers even more RAM and Qi wireless charging, in a first for any of Amazon's hardware.
