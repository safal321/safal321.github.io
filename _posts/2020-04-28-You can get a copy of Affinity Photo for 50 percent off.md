Serif's Affinity Photo desktop application is $25 per license right now directly through Serif itself, B&H Photo (via Slickdeals), and through the respective app stores on Windows 10, macOS, and iPadOS. It's usually $50 ($20 in the case of the iPad), and if you're in need of a comprehensive, affordable alternative to Adobe Photoshop, this deal is up your alley. In case you haven't heard of Affinity Photo, it's a fully featured photo manipulation app that offers many of the same tools found in Photoshop, including native support for .PSD files and Photoshop plugins. One of its most appealing traits is that the app is a one-time cost with no monthly fee.
