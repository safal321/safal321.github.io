After a month of testing on university campuses, California's governor just announced that the state is launching its COVID contact tracing app to the public this Thursday, December 10th. The app is called CA Notify, and its launch makes California the 18th state (plus Washington, DC) to release a contact tracing app. It's also the largest to have done so since the technology was announced in April. The first app of its kind was released in Virginia back in August, so it's been quite a long time coming, especially considering California is home to Apple and Google, the two companies that developed the contact tracing technology the app uses.
