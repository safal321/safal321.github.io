Noise-canceling headphones are an essential piece of kit during regular life when commuting to work, traveling, or if you're trying to dull distractions at the office. But they're also important as we continue to tally yet more weeks spent at home. It's always nice to get a reprieve from the people you live with and be in your own private, serene bubble for a while â€” and noise-canceling headphones are a good way to find that peace and quiet. Since they envelop your ears, wireless headphones will always do better at erasing surrounding distractions than noise-canceling earbuds like the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM3s.
