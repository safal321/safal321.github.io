Tech startup Nothing will announce its debut pair of true wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear (1), on July 27th, the company's founder Carl Pei announced today. The launch comes around a month later than the June launch window Nothing previously announced, after Pei tweeted that the company was delaying the launch because it had “a few things left to finalize.” Carl Pei is best known as one of the co-founders of OnePlus, a company he parted ways with last year.
