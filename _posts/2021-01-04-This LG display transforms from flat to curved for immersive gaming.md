LG Display's latest prototype is a 48-inch flexible OLED panel that can be bent for gaming or flattened for watching TV. The company has shown off similar bendable TV prototypes before, like when it demonstrated a 65-inch TV meant for use inside planes that could bend into a curve for passengers to watch movies. This model, which is being shown off at this year's virtual CES, features LG Display's Cinematic Sound OLED (CSO) technology, which vibrates the screen to produce audio.
