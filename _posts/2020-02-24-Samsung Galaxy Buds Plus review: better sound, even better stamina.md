Samsung's original Galaxy Buds were a decent first go at true wireless earbuds: they offered impressive battery life, wireless charging, and a lightweight, comfortable fit. But sound quality was merely okay, and their built-in mics were awful when it came to voice calls. If you got the $129 Galaxy Buds as a phone preorder bonus or on sale at a discount, there was reason to be happy. But paying full price for them wasn't as easy to justify.
