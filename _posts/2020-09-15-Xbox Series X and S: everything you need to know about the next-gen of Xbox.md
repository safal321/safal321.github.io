The next-generation of Xbox gaming is a little more complicated than what we're used to. This past week, Microsoft announced it's releasing not one but two new consoles: the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S. Not only that, but Microsoft's initial crop of first-party games will also be playable on its last generation Xbox, the Xbox One, as well as Windows PCs. And that's before we get into Microsoft's game streaming service, xCloud, which could mean you won't need any Xbox hardware at all to play many of the latest games.
