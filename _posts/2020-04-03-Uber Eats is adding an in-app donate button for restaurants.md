Uber Eats is adding an in-app donate button for customers who want to contribute some extra cash to their favorite restaurant to help during the coronavirus pandemic. Uber also plans to match every contribution dollar-for-dollar up to $2 million to the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund, with an additional $3 million donation also going to the fund. Uber says that 100 percent of customer donations will go directly to their restaurant of choice.
