Amazon is launching a new series of health programs called WorkingWell designed to prevent workplace injuries in the company's expansive system of warehouses and distribution centers in the US. While the new health program is an attempt to address the 40 percent of work-related injuries Amazon has identified as musculoskeletal disorders (think carpal tunnel syndrome or back pain), it doesn't come with any changes to the long shifts and demanding working conditions that might cause them.
