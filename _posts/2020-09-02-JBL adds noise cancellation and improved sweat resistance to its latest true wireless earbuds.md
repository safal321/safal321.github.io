JBL isn't a newcomer to true wireless earbuds, but today the company is announcing several new sets with noise cancellation at prices that reflect just how competitive the market has become. The JBL Club Pro Plus earbuds ($199.95) have adaptive noise cancellation and “a unibody design inspired by professional in-ear monitors” and offer JBL's best sound quality with up to eight hours of continuous battery life (plus 24 extra hours with the battery case).
