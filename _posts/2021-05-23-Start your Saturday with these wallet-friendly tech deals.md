At The Verge, we strive to bring you the best deals we can find â€” after all, not everyone has the time to comb through endless product listings and retailer pages. The past week has seen some good buys, including deals on the iPhone 11 Pro and the best noise-canceling headphones you can buy, but many of the week's top deals will continue through the weekend. Right now, for instance, you can save $24 on the second-gen Apple Pencil and score Tile's latest Bluetooth tracker at its lowest price in months. It's the weekend, y'all. Have at it.
