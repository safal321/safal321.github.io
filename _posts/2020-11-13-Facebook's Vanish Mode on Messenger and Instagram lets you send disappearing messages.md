Facebook's latest take on a signature Snapchat feature is arriving today, and it's called Vanish Mode. First announced as part of its big September redesign of Messenger, Vanish Mode is an ephemeral messaging mode for both Facebook Messenger and Instagram that will you let you send texts, photos, voice messages, emoji, and stickers that disappear immediately once they're viewed by other parties and the chat window is closed.
