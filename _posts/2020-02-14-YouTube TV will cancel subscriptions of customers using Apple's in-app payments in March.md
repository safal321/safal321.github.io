YouTube TV already stopped accepting new signups through in-app subscriptions on the iPhone and iPad a while ago, and now YouTube has decided it's had enough of splitting subscription revenues from its TV service with Apple. As noted by MacRumors, the company is emailing YouTube TV customers with a warning that it plans to phase out support for in-app payments altogether in March. After that, Apple device owners will have to subscribe to YouTube TV via a web browser.
