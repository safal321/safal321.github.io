The Element Lite is not the kind of laptop that Maingear usually makes. Compared to its fleet of game-ready laptops, this one stands out with a sleek, minimalist, and thin aluminum-clad design. It's the only machine in Maingear's current lineup of laptops that doesn't have a dedicated graphics chip. Unsurprisingly, it's lacking in the gaming department by comparison, but it's practically bursting with other niceties you'd usually find in other high-end productivity laptops, like a Windows Hello IR webcam, Thunderbolt 4, USB-C charging, long battery life, and a touchscreen. Its speakers are good, too.
