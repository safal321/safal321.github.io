Did you know that you could mute all system audio by simply holding the mute button on the DualSense for about one second? I've had a PS5 for months, yet I only now realized this hidden feature exists after watching a YouTube video that the algorithm served me. You'll know it's working when the orange mute light strobes softly, then you won't hear any system sounds.
