Google is launching an initiative to provide more than $150 million to promote education and equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines, the company announced today. It's going to make some Google facilities — buildings, parking lots, and open spaces — available as vaccination clinics, with plans to open sites in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kirkland, Washington, and New York City first, and expand nationally as vaccines become more widely available.
