Nvidia has delayed the launch of its upcoming GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card so there's more stock available on launch day. Writing in a blog post, the company admitted that the news “may be disappointing” to some, but said that “this shift will help our global partners get more graphics cards into the hands of gamers on launch day.” The graphics card will now launch on October 29th, rather than October 15th.
