Samsung's Unpacked 2020 event is happening now. The company jumped right in with the announcements by unveiling the Galaxy Z Flip foldable phone. We also expect the company to unveil the Samsung Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra. That's already plenty of announcements, but there could be a few more.
