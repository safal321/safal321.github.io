V-Moda has announced a new version of its M-200 headphones at CES 2021 â€” the M-200 ANC, which bring both Bluetooth and active noise cancellation to the classic V-Moda design. Those additions come with a jump in price, though, with the M-200 ANC starting at $499.99, a jump of $150 over the wired, non-noise cancelling version.
