I write about and review cutting edge tech products for a living, yet every time I pick up a new piece of hardware I always think about my toaster. Not because I'm obsessed with bread, but more that my toaster is designed for how humans actually use gadgets. I use my toaster every week, and it's a constant reminder of how other products are often badly designed.
