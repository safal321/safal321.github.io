Bang & Olufsen's Beosound Level is the Danish brand's latest battery-powered connected speaker. It supports voice controls via Google Assistant, Bluetooth, and you can also stream to it via the AirPlay 2, Chromecast, and Spotify Connect standards. B&O says the Beosound Level uses a modular construction that it claims will make it usable far into the future. It's a welcome feature, considering the speaker's high $1,499 (xc2xa31,099) starting price.
