Razer has released three new wireless gaming products, each in a different category. There's the $179.99 BlackShark V2 Pro wireless gaming headset that is, in many ways, just like the BlackShark V2 â€” sans cable. It's similarly a very comfortable headset that I've found easy to wear for hours on end without feeling fatigued or like my head is in a vice. Razer claims it can last up to 24 hours per charge, and the headset is rechargeable via a Micro USB port.
