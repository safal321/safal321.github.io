Amazon's new second-generation Echo Buds are the company's second crack at true wireless earbuds. They're smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than before, and now have more effective noise cancellation. The first time around, Amazon borrowed some of Bose's tech to help the original Echo Buds block outside noise, but version two was built completely in-house. Hands-free Alexa voice commands still get top billing, but the most compelling thing about the Echo Buds is still their aggressive price â€” and the solid mix of features you get in exchange.
