If you're looking to do some PC gaming at respectable frame rates, Asus' ROG Strix G15 gaming laptop seems like an affordable way to go about doing that. Usually $1,000, it's $880 today. Despite its low price, it has some high-end features, like Intel's 10th Gen Core i7-10750H six-core processor, a fast 512GB PCIe-based SSD, and an 144Hz refresh rate display that will provide a fluid-looking experience in and out of gameplay.
