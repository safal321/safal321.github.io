For those interested in dipping their toes into the waters of PC gaming, but aren't quite ready to take the full plunge, NZXT has a pretty solid offer as part of its new update to its Starter series of prebuilt machines first introduced last year. For $699, you can buy a solidly capable entry-level gaming PC with one of NZXT's pretty sleek-looking tower cases, in either white or black.
