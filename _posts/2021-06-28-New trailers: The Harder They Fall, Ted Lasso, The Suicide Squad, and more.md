Since it was one of the top picks on Netflix and everyone's talking about it, I started watching Manifest and got five episodes in before I realized it was basically a version of Lost with a few wacky twists and I am not falling for THAT again. But the deeply weird and wonderful The Good Fight is back, and the pilot had Christine Baranski and Audra McDonald at their best, so I can't wait to see what happens this season (although we said goodbye to two of the show's best characters, boo). Also can we talk about Loki? We probably can't without giving away spoilers but episode three gave us a LOT, most of which I suspect were attempts at misdirection.
