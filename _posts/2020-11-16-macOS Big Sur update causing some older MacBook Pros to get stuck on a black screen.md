The macOS Big Sur update has been causing some older MacBook Pros to get stuck on a black screen during installation, with no way that users can find to fix it. The issue seems to be most common on late-2013 and mid-2014 models of the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Owners of other Macs have reported Big Sur installation issues, too — and some say they've been able to fix those issues — but those two models of MacBook Pro seem to be having the most severe problems for now.
