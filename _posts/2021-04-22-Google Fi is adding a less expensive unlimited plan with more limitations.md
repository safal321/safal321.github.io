Google Fi has announced a basic, less expensive unlimited plan called Simply Unlimited in addition to its current unlimited offering, now called Unlimited Plus. The new plan costs $60 per month for a single line and forgoes a couple of features available on the more expensive plan: international data and mobile tethering. It's the second time the MVNO has introduced a new unlimited plan, each marking a step toward a more conventional wireless plan pricing structure.
