Today's deals are a mix of low-priced gadgets made even more affordable as well as some high-end products that don't usually see a discount. The biggest price cut is on DJI's Osmo Action 4K HDR camera. It usually costs $500, but today at Amazon, you can get it for $288. The price reduction is impressive, but what makes this deal extra special is that the camera comes with a 128GB microSD card and DJI's Care Refresh service plan that allows up to two replacement units in one year.
