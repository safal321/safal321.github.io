I haven't done this in a while. Then again, neither has our country — at least not really. It has been a long seven years since Trayvon Martin's death, and a longer six since the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, brought the movement for civil rights home to a younger generation. This isn't to say there haven't been other protests for murdered Black people in the last decade — there have — but none have been so nationally recognized as the killing of George Floyd. In a manner of speaking, the brutality we saw in Missouri was the dry tinder that Floyd's death sparked into open flame.
