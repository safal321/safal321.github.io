Huawei has announced the Mate X2, its first all-new foldable device since 2019's Mate X. The new phone has received a radical redesign compared to the original device, with a large screen that unfolds from the inside of the device rather than around the outside. For using the phone while folded, the Huawei Mate X2 has a second screen on its outside, similar to Samsung's approach with the Galaxy Fold series. Images of the phone were leaked ahead of its official announcement by Evan Blass on Voice. The Mate X2 launch event has only just kicked off in China.
