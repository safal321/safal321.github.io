The Department of Justice has released a proposal for changing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, urging Congress to pass a dramatic reduction in the law's scope and expose services like apps and websites to greater legal liability. The proposal creates new categories of “egregious content” that wouldn't be covered, makes it potentially easier to sue for content removal, and denies protection if a service “purposefully facilitates or solicits third-party content” that's illegal.
