Last month, The Verge broke news of Mark Cuban and Falon Fatemi's new app Fireside, which promises to deliver a “next-gen podcast platform,” and today, we can provide a better sense of the app's functionality and interface. It's currently in beta on iOS with a limited number of testers, most of whom appear to work in venture capital or as podcasters. However, their chats are visible to anyone, even non-users, through a browser, and from this desktop view, as well as screenshots of the app that The Verge has viewed, we can get a sense of what Fireside is trying to achieve.
