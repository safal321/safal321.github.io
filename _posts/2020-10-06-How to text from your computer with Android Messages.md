Google has the ability to text from the web with Android Messages. The feature gives users a lot more flexibility in choosing how and where they can carry on conversations. As long as your Android smartphone is powered on, you can text from a desktop computer or even other mobile devices â€” including iOS products like an iPad if you just open up Safari. Aside from text, you can also send emoji, stickers, and images over the web.
