Razer has announced two wireless gaming headsets that are available starting today, and they're made specifically for the new Xbox Series X, Series S and Xbox One consoles. The $150 Kaira Pro and the $100 Kaira borrow the same drivers from the Blackshark V2 series of headsets, and add some new features to make both models alluring for their respective price points.
