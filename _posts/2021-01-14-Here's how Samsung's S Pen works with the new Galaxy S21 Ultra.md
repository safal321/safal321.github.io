Samsung's new Galaxy S21 Ultra supports the company's S Pen stylus. Support for the accessory has been a staple of Samsung's Galaxy Note smartphones for years, but this is the first time it's been supported in the company's Galaxy S-series. The stylus will be available as an optional $39.99 accessory, and Samsung says the S21 Ultra will also work with S Pens from other Galaxy Note or Galaxy Tab devices.
