Google is introducing a new Camera Go app for its Android Go range of entry-level devices. Android Go originally debuted two years ago as a more stripped-down version of Android designed to run on inexpensive low-end devices, and it's now running on 100 million active devices. Google created Go versions of Gmail, YouTube, and other key services, but a better camera app was always missing.
