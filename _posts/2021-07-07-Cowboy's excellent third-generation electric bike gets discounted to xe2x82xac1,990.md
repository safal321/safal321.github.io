Cowboy's third generation electric bike, the appropriately named Cowboy 3, has received another discount. Going forward, it will now sell for xe2x82xac1,990 (xc2xa31,690), xe2x82xac300 cheaper than its original launch price of xe2x82xac2,290. That price includes mudguards, which Cowboy recently started including as standard, as well as free delivery in 10 days. This latest price cut comes a little over two months after Cowboy reduced the price of its third-gen bike to xe2x82xac2,190.
