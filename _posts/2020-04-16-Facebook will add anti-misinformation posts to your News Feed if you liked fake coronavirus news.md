Facebook will start putting anti-misinformation messages in the News Feeds of people who have engaged with fake coronavirus stories. The company offered an update on its fight against harmful misinformation today, announcing the launch of a couple of new features for promoting accurate news. One of these is a box that will appear for people who liked, reacted to, or commented on a post that Facebook later removed, encouraging them to visit the World Health Organization's site. Facebook is separately launching a “Get the Facts” section full of vetted news about the pandemic.
