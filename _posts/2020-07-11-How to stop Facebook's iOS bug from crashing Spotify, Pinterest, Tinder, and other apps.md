Facebook's iOS SDK is causing a number of popular iPhone apps to crash today, including Spotify, Pinterest, and Tinder. You don't even need to have the Facebook app installed for other apps to crash, as developers have implemented the Facebook login through their own apps. This is the second time the issue has occurred in recent months, but there is a workaround available to get the apps back up and running before Facebook fixes the problems.
