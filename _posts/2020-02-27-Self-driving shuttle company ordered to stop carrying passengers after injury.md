The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has partially suspended the US operations of France's EasyMile after a passenger in Ohio was injured while riding in one of the company's self-driving shuttles. EasyMile can continue operating its shuttles while NHTSA investigates, but the company can't carry any passengers.
