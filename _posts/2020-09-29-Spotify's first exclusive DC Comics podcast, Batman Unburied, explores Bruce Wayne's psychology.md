Spotify announced the first podcast that'll come out of its exclusive DC Comics deal today: a new show called Batman Unburied. The narrative podcast will explore the “darker aspects of Bruce Wayne's psychology.” It'll debut in 2021, and for now, no other details are being released. David S. Goyer, the screenwriter behind Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, will executive produce the podcast. Goyer also came up with the idea behind the story.
