Jordan Fisher is the kind of multi-hyphenate performer who is impossible to summarize in a sentence. He's in film, on television and Broadway, and somehow he finds the time to keep a regular streaming schedule on Twitch. But more than that, he's sincere. I can honestly say that's what struck me the most about Fisher. (That said: let's be real, the dude is extremely handsome.)
