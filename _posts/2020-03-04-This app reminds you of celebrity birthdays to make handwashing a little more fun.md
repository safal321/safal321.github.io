The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that you wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds to mitigate the spread of germs. In light of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that continues to spread and impact several countries and industries around the globe, that's especially important. To make it easier to do your part, the CDC says you can sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice. But exactly whose birth are you singing in honor of? One cannot simply sing the song, let alone sing it twice, if you don't know who you're singing for — and doing it for random strangers isn't enough encouragement.
