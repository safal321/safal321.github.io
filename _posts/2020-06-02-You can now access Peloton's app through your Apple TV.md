Peloton is making its app available on one more device: Apple TVs. The company announced its partnership with Apple today, which will bring the workout streaming app to Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD devices. New members can access the app on their TV for a free 30-day trial, too. The app is already available on iOS devices and the Apple Watch but is notably missing a desktop component.
