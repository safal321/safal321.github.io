The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader you can buy, and today, this model is back down to its lowest price yet. Instead of $130, it costs $85 for the 8GB model with special offers (Amazon's ads baked into the lockscreen, which you can bypass for $20 after you buy it). We cover this deal whenever it happens for a few reasons: it's a very good e-reader that's waterproof and has a pin-sharp backlit display.
