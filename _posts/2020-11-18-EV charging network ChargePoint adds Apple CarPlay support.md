EV charging network provider ChargePoint is now tightly integrated with Apple CarPlay. That means drivers can now find a ChargePoint charging station, navigate to it, and start a charging session from their car's infotainment screen without having to pick up their phone while traveling to launch the ChargePoint app. The feature is available starting today in the USA, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK.
