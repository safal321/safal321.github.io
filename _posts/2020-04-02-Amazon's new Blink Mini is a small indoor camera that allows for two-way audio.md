The latest addition to Amazon's Blink lineup of home security cams is the Blink Mini, a compact indoor camera that supports two-way audio. It's available for preorder through Amazon now for $35 (two of them cost $65, saving you $5), and it will release in a few weeks. Considering the low cost, it seems to hit all of the fundamentals that you might expect from a home security camera, plus some.
