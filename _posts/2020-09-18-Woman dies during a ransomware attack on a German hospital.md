A woman in Germany died during a ransomware attack on the Duesseldorf University Hospital, in what may be the first death directly linked to a cyberattack on a hospital. The hospital couldn't accept emergency patients because of the attack, and the woman was sent to a health care facility around 20 miles away, the Associated Press reported.
