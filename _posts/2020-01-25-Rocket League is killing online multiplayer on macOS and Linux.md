Today, Epic Games-owned Psyonix announced that it will stop supporting Rocket League on macOS and Linux starting in March. Psyonix says it will release a final patch on both platforms that month that will turn off online features, which means you won't be able to play online multiplayer anymore. You'll still be able to play matches with your friends sitting in front of your computer, though.
