May 4th is the annual Star Wars-themed holiday, and several sales have already begun to celebrate the franchise. One of the most notable so far is the PC version of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Respawn's excellent (and surprisingly challenging) third-person adventure. The digital code (redeemable on Origin) costs $30 instead of $60 at Amazon.
