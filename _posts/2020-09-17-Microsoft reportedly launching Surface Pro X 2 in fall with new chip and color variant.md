Microsoft is reportedly planning to refresh its ARM-powered Surface Pro X this fall. Windows Central reports that the Surface Pro X will be updated to include Microsoft's SQ2 processor, which will likely be based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 5G. It's not clear if this refreshed Surface Pro X will include 5G support, but Qualcomm's latest chip supports the option for Microsoft to include it.
