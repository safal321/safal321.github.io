The best gaming laptop of 2021 looks different from those of years past. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements â€” clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top gaming laptops now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren't just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. That's why the best gaming laptop of 2021 is the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.
