The Cat S62 Pro — and that's Cat as in Caterpillar, the construction company — is now available in the US. The rugged smartphone is the latest device to feature Cat branding (it's technically a product of licensee Bullitt Group) and builds on its predecessors' integrated thermal camera capabilities. It's designed with construction and industrial workers in mind,  and at $699, it's a more attractively priced follow up to 2018's S61, which debuted in the US at $899.
