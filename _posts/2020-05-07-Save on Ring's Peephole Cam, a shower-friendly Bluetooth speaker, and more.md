Today's best deals are, as usual, a mix of returning favorites and some new ones that we've picked up along the way. While we featured some big-ticket items yesterday, today's roundup is focused more on practical additions to your home that won't cost a whole lot. One such product is the Ring Peephole Cam, which is cheaper for readers of The Verge with an exclusive offer code from Daily Steals. Instead of $130, which is the current price at Amazon, you can snag one for yourself for $107 with the offer code VERGERBELL used at checkout.
