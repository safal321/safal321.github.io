Best Buy is hosting a one-day sale on tech in practically every category. We've picked out a few that are currently in stock, including a bundle containing Microsoft's new Surface Go 2 and a Type Cover is $474. Usually, the tablet is $400, and the Type Cover will cost you at least another $100 on top of that, so this is a modest $25 discount on the package. The chances are good that you're looking for a Type Cover with your new Surface Go 2, so you might as well save a little money.
