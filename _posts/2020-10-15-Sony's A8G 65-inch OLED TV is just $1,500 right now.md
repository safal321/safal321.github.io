We're in the final day of Prime Day 2020, and there are some stellar Lightning Deals happening. One that's happening right now is on Sony's 65-inch A8G OLED 4K television. Normally $1,998, it's down to $1,500 for a limited time. This deal is set to last until 5PM ET today, but I have my doubts it will remain in stock for that long.
