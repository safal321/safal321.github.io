Samsung's Sero TV, which rotates between landscape and portrait orientations depending on what kind of content you're watching, has gone on sale in the UK. Samsung says that the 43-inch TV is available for xc2xa31,599. That's a lot considering the TV's relatively small screen size, but you're still getting a 4K QLED panel.
