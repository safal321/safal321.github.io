SideQuest has launched an Android app that lets you do the same neat trick as its desktop app: sideload VR content from outside the official Oculus Store onto your Quest or Quest 2 VR headset. The free app, which releases today, lets you browse SideQuest's offerings and transfer content over Wi-Fi or a USB cable. That means you don't need a PC to install VR games, demos, and apps from SideQuest's community.
