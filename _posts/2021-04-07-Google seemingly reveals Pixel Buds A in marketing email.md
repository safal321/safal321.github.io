As we approach Google I/O 2021, the rumor mill has started pointing to new hardware, including a Pixel 5A and Pixel Buds A, a lower-cost set of true wireless earbuds that would slot in below the company's main pair. Google seems to have gotten ahead of itself, however, as, according to 9to5Google, a new email contains an image of olive green Pixel Buds that aren't part of the current lineup. The interior of the case is also color-matched to the buds, which isn't the case with the second-gen Pixel Buds. Another clue that these are new is that the inside-facing part of the earbuds is also the same green.
