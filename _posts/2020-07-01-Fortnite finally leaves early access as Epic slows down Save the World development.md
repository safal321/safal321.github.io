Fortnite's iconic Battle Royale game mode took the world by storm, and today, Epic Games has announced that it'll finally be removing the early access label from both the free-to-play shooter and the less popular original Save the World mode. Epic also announced that Save the World will continue to be a paid title separate from the free-to-play Battle Royale, and with the “official” launch, it'll start slowing down the release of content for Save the World.
