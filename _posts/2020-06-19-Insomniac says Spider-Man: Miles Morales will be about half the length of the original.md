Insomniac Games has confirmed its upcoming PlayStation 5 launch title, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, will be about half the length of the original game. In a blog post published Thursday, creative director Brian Horton said the game would be roughly the size of 2017's Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, which, since its release, has become an industry reference point for talking about the scope and length of narrative expansions in games. The Lost Legacy clocked in at about 7 to 10 hours of play time, according to data from HowLongToBeat.com, and was about half the size of the Uncharted game it was based on.
