In an effort to help political campaigns tighten security, Google is partnering with nonprofit organization Defending Digital Campaigns to give qualifying political groups free access to Titan security keys. The physical keys, used as part of Google's Advanced Protection security program,  provide another level of two-factor authentication to protect Google accounts. And perhaps even more significantly, the new partnership won't leave it to campaigns to set up the security measures themselves, but will provide help with installation and activation.
