Samsung has taken the wraps off it and Google's new unified smartwatch platform at MWC 2021 â€” sort of. The company isn't announcing a new Galaxy Watch today, or even what the new platform will be called (it's unofficially referred to as Wear); those announcements will come later this summer at a proper Galaxy Unpacked event. But what Samsung did show off was a first look at what its new One UI Watch software will look like, and it elaborated on just what the new Google / Samsung partnership could mean for future Galaxy Watches.
