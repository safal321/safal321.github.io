Woot's excellent pre-Prime Day 2020 deal on the Apple AirPods Pro wireless earbuds is over. All of the stock is sold out, apparently. They were $190, which was the best price we've seen yet. This model usually costs $250, and Woot says this discount will last all day, or until it sells out. Perhaps we'll see this deal come back for Prime Day 2020.
