If you're moving from LastPass (or another password manager you're dissatisfied with), you may be tempted to simply go with the password manager that comes with your browser or operating system. It's certainly an easy solution, and a reasonable one, depending on your point of view. Until recently, third-party password managers were known to be more secure, but Apple and Google have been working to make their built-in password managers more secure, while Microsoft is adding one to its authenticator app. So it could be a viable choice.
