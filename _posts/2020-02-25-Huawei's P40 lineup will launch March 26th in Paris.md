Huawei will unveil its next flagship phones, the P40 and P40 Pro, on March 26th at an event in Paris, the company announced today (via Android Central). Unlike their impressive P-series predecessors, however, the P40s will not have access to Google's various apps and services (including the Google Play Store) since the White House has banned US companies from doing business with the Chinese telecom giant. Huawei's Mate 30 Pro launched under similar constraints last year. Google addressed the situation on Friday and discouraged consumers from trying to sideload its software.
