Sony's next-gen PlayStation 5 console has a massive internal cooling system composed of, among other things, a gigantic fan. But the device, a 120mm-wide and 45mm-thick double-sided intake fan, also has some smart software to power it, and that software will improve the fan's performance over time based on data gathered from individual games, according to a new interview with Yasuhiro Ootori, Sony's mechanical design chief in charge of the PS5, with Japanese language website 4Gamer.net.
