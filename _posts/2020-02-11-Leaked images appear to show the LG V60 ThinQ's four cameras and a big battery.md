Just a few weeks ahead of Mobile World Congress 2020, two marketing images of the LG V60 ThinQ have leaked. Each one appears to show off a prominent hardware feature, and it's good news all around if you like phones with big batteries, lots of cameras, and a headphone jack. Both images come from Evan Blass on Twitter (via GSMArena) who is a leaker with a reliable track record.
