OnePlus is working on a “more affordable smartphone product line,” CEO Pete Lau confirmed in a forum post today. Although Lau doesn't specifically name the new range, his post links to a new Instagram page titled “OnePlusLiteZThing,” which is an apparent reference to the rumored names for the device. Lau said OnePlus plans to bring the devices to Europe and India first but that the company was looking to bring its affordable phones to North America in the “near future.”
