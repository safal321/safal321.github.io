Razer is bringing a heap of spec improvements to its 2021 lineup of Blade 15 and Pro 17 gaming laptops. The fit and finish of both models are largely the same as before — they are still ahead of the competition in terms of design — though I'm going to assume that they're still total fingerprint magnets. However, the switch that I'm most excited about is that QHD screens are finally happening. You'll be able to get a 1440p QHD display with a fast refresh rate and with Nvidia's G-Sync variable refresh rate tech built in.
