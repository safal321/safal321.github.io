Microsoft is laying off dozens of journalists and editorial workers at its Microsoft News and MSN organizations. The layoffs are part of a bigger push by Microsoft to rely on artificial intelligence to pick news and content that's presented on MSN.com, inside Microsoft's Edge browser, and in the company's various Microsoft News apps. Many of the affected workers are part of Microsoft's SANE (search, ads, News, Edge) division, and are contracted as human editors to help pick stories.
