Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro keeps getting a little more affordable. B&H Photo is offering $300 off the cost for the base model, which brings it down to $2,100. Earlier this week, Best Buy was taking $200 off, so it worked out in your favor if you waited. In case you aren't up to speed on what's new in this model, Apple debuted its new Magic Keyboard with this, ditching the much-maligned butterfly switches for something far better. Aside from having a slightly larger screen than the previous 15-inch model, it also has improved thermals and better speakers.
