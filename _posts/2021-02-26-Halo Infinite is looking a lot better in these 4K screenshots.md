We got our first look at Halo Infinite, the next game in Microsoft's huge franchise, back in July, and the results were... underwhelming. The graphics and visuals weren't quite as impressive as you might expect from a next-generation game (the demo was running on a PC “that is representative of the experience that players will have on Xbox Series X”), and one vacant-looking enemy even became the infamous Craig meme. The game was delayed to 2021 a few weeks after the demo aired “to ensure the team has adequate time to deliver a Halo game experience that meets our vision.”
