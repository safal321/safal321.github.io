Vivo has announced its new Android-based operating system at its annual developer conference in China. OriginOS is the successor to FuntouchOS and features a complete design overhaul that prioritizes widgets, arranging them in a grid-like layout. The widgets can update themselves with notifications called “nano alerts.”
