GoPro's new flagship action camera — the Hero 9 Black — has arrived, bringing with it one of the most significant updates in years to the product lineup. In addition to a new design that features a front-facing color display, the Hero 9 Black improves on nearly every aspect of the device, with better resolution for stills and video, a larger battery, better video stabilization, and more. The downside: those changes also bring a bigger $449.99 price tag, $50 more than 2019's Hero 8 Black.
