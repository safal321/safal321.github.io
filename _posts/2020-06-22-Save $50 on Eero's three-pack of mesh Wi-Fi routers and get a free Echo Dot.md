Eero's three-pack of mesh Wi-Fi routers is down to $200 at Amazon, which is $50 off the cost of the bundle. As far as complete mesh Wi-Fi systems are concerned, this is currently one of the most affordable. In Dan Seifert's review, he claims they're very easy to set up. If your current Wi-Fi router hasn't been cutting it, either due to connectivity issues or the fact that it doesn't do a good job pushing signal to every corner of your home, this is a smart upgrade to make now.
