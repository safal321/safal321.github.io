If you have high standards for sound quality, comfort, and features, Sony's WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones are probably already high up on your wishlist â€” if you don't already own them. They're featured today because you can get $72 off their normal $350 cost, bringing them down to $278. For context, they haven't been cheaper than this (though, around Black Friday, retailers were throwing in a $25 gift card with purchase). Visually, they're very similar to their predecessor, the XM3, but these have a sensor that can automatically pause or resume music when you put them on, and they can handle two Bluetooth connections simultaneously.
