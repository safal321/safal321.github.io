Microsoft posted the second quarter of its 2020 financial results today, reporting revenue of $36.9 billion and net income of $11.6 billion. Surface and Office are both up, and revenue from Windows licenses has also increased just as Windows 7 support comes to an end. Gaming revenue is down a massive 21 percent, and Microsoft is blaming some of that on a strong quarter of a third-party game last year.
