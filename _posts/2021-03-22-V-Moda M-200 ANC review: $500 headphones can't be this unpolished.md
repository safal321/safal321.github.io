Apple's AirPods Max just might have ushered in a new norm of $500-plus wireless headphones. My argument in support of this? V-Moda's new M-200 ANC headphones, which sell for $499.99 and, as the name makes obvious, are the company's first headphones to include active noise cancellation. V-Moda is a company that's well-known in the DJ world, and prior headphones like the original M100s and Crossfade 2 Wireless have earned it some fans in the audiophile crowd. With the M-200 ANCs, V-Moda is trying to compete in a higher price bracket than ever before â€” but the results are a little uneven.
