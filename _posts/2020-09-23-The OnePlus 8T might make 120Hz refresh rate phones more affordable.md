It looks like OnePlus might finally make 120Hz smartphones more affordable â€” because its upcoming OnePlus 8T will include that higher refresh rate, the company confirmed today. The T-series of OnePlus phones typically serve as a half-step between its numbered phones, but bring premium features from the company's Pro models, like that 120Hz screen, to a lower price. The OnePlus 7T did the same thing last year, by bringing the OnePlus 7 Pro's 90Hz screen to $599.
