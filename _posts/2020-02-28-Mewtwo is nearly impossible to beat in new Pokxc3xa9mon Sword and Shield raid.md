In celebration of Pokxc3xa9mon Day, there's a new raid battle for Mewtwo, which is perhaps the most legendary of all of the legendary pokxc3xa9mon, in Pokxc3xa9mon Sword and Pokxc3xa9mon Shield. I was excited for the chance to take on one of my favorite monsters in the series â€” though sadly, the game doesn't let you catch it. But even when I brought my best pokxc3xa9mon to the battle, I consistently got my clock cleaned.
