Sling TV, Dish's live TV streaming service, announced that it's raising the prices on its packages and add-ons for new customers starting today. Both the Orange and Blue channel packages from Sling will go up by $5 to $35 per month for new subscribers or $50 per month when bundled together. Because of Sling's existing one-year price guarantee, current subscribers won't have to deal with the new prices until August 2021.
