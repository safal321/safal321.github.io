Facebook is giving augmented reality effects creators more places to share their work. The company announced, as part of its Facebook Connect event today, that it'll expand third-party creators' reach to both Messenger and Portal, meaning effects they create through Spark AR, Facebook's AR program, can show up in that app and device, too. (AR effects already existed in both Messenger and Portal, but those effects will soon come from creators outside of Facebook's in-house team.) The team says it'll have updates about when the third-party effects will roll out early next year.
