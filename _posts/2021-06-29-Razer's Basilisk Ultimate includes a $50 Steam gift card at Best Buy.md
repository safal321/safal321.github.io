Best Buy is offering an attractive deal on Razer's Basilisk Ultimate wireless gaming mouse that includes a charging dock. The current price is $40 off, and you'll get a $50 gift card to Steam for no extra cost. Amazon is selling this mouse for a similar price, but the Steam gift card bundle is exclusive to Best Buy. Perhaps it's no coincidence that Steam is looped into this deal since its big Summer Sale is happening, bringing discounts to many digital PC games through July 8th. This $50 could get you several games or pay for all of Mass Effect Legendary Edition, as an example.
