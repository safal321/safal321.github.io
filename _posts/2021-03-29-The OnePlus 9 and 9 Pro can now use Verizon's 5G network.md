The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are now certified for use on Verizon's network, which means Verizon customers will be able to use the phones with the carrier's 5G network; without certification, the phones would be limited to LTE. The news was announced today by a Verizon representative, but the timeline is a little unclear. OnePlus had said it was working with Verizon, but there were no promises that it would be done by the phone's launch.
