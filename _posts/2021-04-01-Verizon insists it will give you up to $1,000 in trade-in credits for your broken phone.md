April Fools Day is at hand, and Verizon has willingly stepped into the fray with a deal that seems too good to be true — especially for people who have a broken, useless phone. The US carrier insists that starting tomorrow, April 1st, customers can trade in an “old, cracked, or water damaged phone” for up to $1,000 off a new 5G phone, like an iPhone 12, or Samsung's Galaxy S21. The promo doesn't extend to phones with battery damage (for safety concerns).
