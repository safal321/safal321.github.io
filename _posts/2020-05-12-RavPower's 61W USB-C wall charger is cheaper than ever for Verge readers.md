RavPower is extending a deep discount on its 61W USB-C wall charger to readers of The Verge. Normally $30, it's just $21 for a limited time. To get this price, you have to clip the $2 coupon (located directly beneath the price on the Amazon product page), then enter the offer code VERGE8MF at checkout. This is the lowest price that we've seen this charger go for, and if you have a Nintendo Switch, MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, a phone, and any other tech that charges via USB-C, this is a cheap way to power your stuff without fetching the original power supply. This code works for the black or white charger.
