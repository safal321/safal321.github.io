Samsung Display has released a teaser for its under-screen camera technology meant for laptops, dubbed “Samsung Blade Bezel,” on its Weibo page. It promises that its “UPC” (Under Panel Camera) tech can make a laptop's bezels smaller without having to relocate its webcam, while also making the OLED display itself be both thinner and lighter. There's no mention of the impact of the technology on the webcam's image quality, however, which has become increasingly important in the age of social distancing.
