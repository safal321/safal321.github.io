I'm here with the latest collection of the best tech deals that appeared on The Verge this week. Similar to the last weekend's post, deals have been ramping up lately. Hopefully it has helped you save a little money either shopping for yourself or a mom in your life for Mother's Day. If you happen to be searching for a belated gift to ship over (orders placed today probably won't arrive by Sunday, May 9th, which is Mother's Day), check out our gift guide that's full of fun gift ideas.
