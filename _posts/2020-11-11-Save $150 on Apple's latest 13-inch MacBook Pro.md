We expect Apple to announce its new Arm-based MacBooks today at its 1PM ET event, but the company's latest Intel-based MacBook Pro with the improved keyboard is $150 off at B&H Photo. The 13.3-inch model with an 8th Gen quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is $1,349, down from $1,499. Other retailers, including Amazon and Best Buy, currently sell it for full price, so if you're looking for a MacBook Pro deal, head over to B&H Photo.
