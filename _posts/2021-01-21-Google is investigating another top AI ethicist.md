Google is investigating artificial intelligence researcher Margaret Mitchell, who co-leads the company's Ethical AI team, and has locked her corporate account, Axios reports. The news comes a little over a month after another prominent AI ethicist, Timnit Gebru, said she was fired by the company. Mitchell's account has now reportedly been locked for “at least a few days” but she hasn't been fired, according to a tweet from Gebru. Mitchell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
