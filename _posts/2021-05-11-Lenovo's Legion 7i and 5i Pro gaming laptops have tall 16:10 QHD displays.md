Lenovo is banking hard on 16-inch QHD displays in the taller 16:10 aspect ratio with its new lineup of Legion 7i and 5i Pro gaming laptops, and I'm all for it. These laptops are a showcase for crisper, more spacious displays that have a fast 165Hz refresh rate and G-Sync support, as well as faster processors by way of Intel's new 11th Gen H-series CPUs. They're also among the first laptops announced to support Nvidia's lower-end GeForce RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti graphics chips, in addition to more powerful GPU options.
