Xiaomi is best known for its affordable phones and accessories, but the list of product categories it's willing to enter grows seemingly by the year. One of the latest is gaming monitors, with a 27-inch model launched in June and a 34-inch ultrawide following last month. I've been testing the latter, and it's actually very good for the price of xe2x82xac399 (or ~$469 â€” real-world euro-dollar conversions tend to be closer to 1:1, though that won't help US importers).
