This could be our first look at the Xbox Series S, Microsoft's cut-down next-gen console that carries the codename Lockhart. An image posted by Thurrott allegedly shows the console's design and reveals a price point of $299. It's not immediately clear where the image came from, but leaker WalkingCat followed up with a short video showing off the same design in relation to the Series X. Analyst Daniel Ahmad also corroborated the image, though couldn't confirm the price.
