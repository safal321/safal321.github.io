Today is the 10th anniversary of the original iPad being announced. Coincidence or not, the seventh-generation iPad with a 10.2-inch display is back down to its lowest price yet (the same excellent price that we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday). The base configuration of its latest model with 32GB of onboard storage costs $249.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. That's $80 off of the usual price, a discount that hasn't been beaten yet.
