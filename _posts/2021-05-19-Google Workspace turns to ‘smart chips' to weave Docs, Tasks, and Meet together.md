Google is launching a slate of new features for its Workspace productivity suite today, starting with new “smart chips” that connect Google Docs to other products. Just like you can tag people with an @ symbol, starting today, you can use it to specialize links inside docs that hook up other files or meetings. They're part of what Google is calling the “smart canvas,” a new initiative that promises to increase the cadence of product improvements for Workspace.
