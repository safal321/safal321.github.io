Apple announced at WWDC this week that you'll be able to add a digital car key to your iPhone or Apple Watch to wirelessly unlock and start your car. The feature is part of the newly revealed iOS 14, and it will work over NFC, Apple says. The first car supported will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series, which comes out next month, and Apple says it's working on an industry-wide standard that would use its new U1 ultra wideband chip instead of relying solely on NFC.
