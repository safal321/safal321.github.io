On Wednesday, October 7th, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Vice President Mike Pence will take the stage for the first and only vice presidential debate of the 2020 campaign. Held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, the event is the second in a series of four debates arranged by the Commission on Presidential Debates, and the first since President Donald Trump's alarming coronavirus diagnosis last week.
