A press render claiming to be LG's unannounced V60 ThinQ has been published by Android Headlines, showing a handset with a small teardrop notch, a dedicated Google Assistant button, and a gold frame. Although not confirmed by the leak, the phone was expected to be announced at the now-cancelled Mobile World Congress. Text on the phone's display reads February 24th, the day MWC 2020 was originally scheduled to begin.
