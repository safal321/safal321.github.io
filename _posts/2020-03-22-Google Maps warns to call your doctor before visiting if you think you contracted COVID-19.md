People are searching for doctors on Google Maps, and the service wants to prevent them from potentially infecting offices and medical specialists with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Google Maps now displays a warning for medical facilities that users should call ahead if they suspect they are infected with the novel coronavirus. Tapping through on the warning brings up the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website and a page about what to do if someone is feeling sick. On iOS, the warning shows up on each location's listing, but on Android devices, it appears in the search results, too.
