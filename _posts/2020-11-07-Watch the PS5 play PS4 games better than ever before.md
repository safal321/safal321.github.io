A new video from Digital Foundry makes it immediately clear that the PS5 brings notable performance improvements to many PS4 games. The 30-minute video shows off a lot of big PS4 titles on running PS5, including Crysis Remastered, Dark Souls 3, Days Gone (with its PS5-exclusive 60fps framerate), Ghost of Tsushima (with its PS5-exclusive 60fps framerate), Hitman, Just Cause 3, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
