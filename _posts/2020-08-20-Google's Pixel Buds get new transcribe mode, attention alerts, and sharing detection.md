Google is adding a number of new features to its Pixel Buds today. A new transcribe mode is designed to translate long speeches directly into your ears, which is ideal for if you're listening to a lecture or speech where a single person is speaking in a language you don't understand. The Pixel Buds have always supported a translation feature, but this transcribe mode is designed for one-way translation instead of conversations back and forth, and it's a more discrete way to translate using the Buds. It will be available initially for French, German, Italian, and Spanish translation into English.
