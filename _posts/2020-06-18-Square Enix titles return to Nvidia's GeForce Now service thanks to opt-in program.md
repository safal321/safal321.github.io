Select Square Enix titles are returning to Nvidia's cloud gaming service GeForce Now, Nvidia announced on Thursday. The new library of Square Enix games consists of 14 PC titles, including the most recent entries in the Deus Ex and Tomb Raider reboot series. Square Enix was one of the earliest game publishers to pull its library of games from GeForce Now when Nvidia launched its paid version back in February, and some previously supported games will still be missing, like the Batman: Arkham series, Nier: Automata, Final Fantasy XV, and Octopath Traveler.
