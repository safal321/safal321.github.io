Nintendo is offering a closer look at the new Game & Watch hardware coming on November  13th that will come preloaded with the original Super Mario Bros. game. In case you missed out on the announcement last week, it's a $49.99 device that's being released in limited quantities for Mario's 35th anniversary celebration â€” and it's likely going to be very difficult to get your hands on one. In addition to the original Mario title, it comes loaded with Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels (released as Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan) and a Mario-themed version of Ball, a new twist on a classic Game & Watch game that first released decades ago.
