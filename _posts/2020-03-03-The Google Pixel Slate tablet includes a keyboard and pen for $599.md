One of the best deals from last year's Black Friday shopping holiday was on the Google Pixel Slate tablet. That deal is back, and it's a little better than before. Not only is it hundreds off of its usual $999 price, it's an extra $50 cheaper than the previous best price, totaling $599 instead of $649 for the midrange configuration with an Intel Core i5 CPU.
