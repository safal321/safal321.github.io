Poolside.fm, an online radio station, might be the chillest place online: a place where it's perpetually the summer of 1997, and where, as the intro copy says, “safety comes second and drinks come first.” Per its founder Marty Bell, the site has dosed a bunch of people with the neurotransmitter they crave — it crossed 1 million listening sessions in the last year with zero staff and zero marketing.
