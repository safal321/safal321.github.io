Nvidia has announced its new RTX 2080 Super and RTX 2070 Super mobile GPUs. These are the company's top-of-the-line (and priciest) RTX cards for laptops, offering a performance bump over the company's standard RTX 2070 and 2080 offerings. They're based on Nvidia's Turing architecture, which includes dedicated “RT Core” hardware designed to drive ray tracing. RTX Super cards first arrived for desktop machines last July, and standard RTX mobile GPUs were only made available shortly after CES 2019.
