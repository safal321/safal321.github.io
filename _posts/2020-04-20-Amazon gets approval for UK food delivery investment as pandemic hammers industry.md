Amazon will provisionally be allowed to invest in UK-based food delivery startup Deliveroo, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced today. Deliveroo originally announced the $575 million funding round lead by Amazon last May, but the CMA was initially worried that the deal could be bad for competition.
