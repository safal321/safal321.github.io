Lumio, the maker of the Lito book-shaped folding light, is following up with another clever design object: a discrete speaker called the Teno. At first glance, the speaker, in either “Arctic White” or “Lava Black,” looks like a small stone bowl with a crack running across it. When pulled open, a warm light is exposed and sound pours out. Both the light and sound can be adjusted via touch sensors.
