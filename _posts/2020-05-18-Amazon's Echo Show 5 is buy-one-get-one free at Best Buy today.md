You can get two of Amazon's Echo Show 5 smart displays for $90 today at Best Buy. To break down why exactly that's a deal worth highlighting, that's the regular price for just one of them. This model has a 5.5-inch display, which makes it easier to fit just about anywhere inside your home. And since this deal includes a second display, you can choose to set it up in a different part of your living space, or you can gift it to someone who you'd like to keep in contact with via its built-in camera.
