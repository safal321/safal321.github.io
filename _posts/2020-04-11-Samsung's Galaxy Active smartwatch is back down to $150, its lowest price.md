The Samsung Galaxy Active smartwatch is $150 at Best Buy, matching the lowest price we've seen just a few times, usually around big shopping holidays like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Today's deal is actually better since Best Buy is throwing in a free $25 gift card with your purchase. Amazon is offering the same price, though it doesn't come with a gift card.
