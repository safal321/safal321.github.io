Spotify's making another big podcasting acquisition. This time, it's buying podcast hosting company Megaphone for $235 million, according to a source close to the companies. The deal doesn't affect Spotify's own podcasts — it already hosted its shows on Megaphone — but it does mean more shows will have access to Spotify's proprietary ad insertion technology, called Streaming Ad Insertion.
