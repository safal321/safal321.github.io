The US Department of the Interior said today it would continue to keep its entire drone fleet grounded, except when used for emergencies like firefighting, as the department reviews if the drones are a threat to national security. The Department of the Interior first grounded its more than 800 drones in October due to concerns that Chinese spying and cyberattacks could be aided by the drones, which are made in China or use Chinese-made parts, The Wall Street Journal reported in October. What this all means is that after months of review, the DOI is still worried that drones may be a potential threat.
