I just played Death Stranding on my wife's beat-up Samsung Chromebook Plus. That's because Nvidia just made it possible to do so with its GeForce Now cloud streaming service, which launched in beta for Chrome OS today. While gaming natively isn't necessarily a strong suit of Chrome OS, support for Google's Stadia and GeForce Now means that you can probably access many of the games in your back catalog from the cloud, wherever you are with your Chromebook. Nvidia is keeping tabs on supported games right here.
