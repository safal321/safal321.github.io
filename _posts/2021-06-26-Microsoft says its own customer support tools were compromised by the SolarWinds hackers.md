Microsoft says some of its customer support tools were accessed by the hacking group Nobelium, which was also connected to the SolarWinds attacks, due to a Microsoft customer service agent's computer being compromised. Microsoft told Reuters that the agent had limited access, and was able to see things like what services customers used, and their billing contact information. According to Microsoft, the hackers used the info gleaned from the tools to start “highly targeted” attacks on specific Microsoft customers.
