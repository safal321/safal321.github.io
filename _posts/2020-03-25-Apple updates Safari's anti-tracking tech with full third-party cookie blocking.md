Apple on Tuesday released a major update to its Safari Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP), the privacy feature that allows the company's web browser to block cookies and prevent advertisers from snooping on your web habits. According to Apple's John Wilander, the WebKit engineer behind the feature, Safari now blocks all third-party cookies. That means that, by default, no advertiser or website is able to follow you around the internet using the commonplace tracking technology.
