Microsoft's new $99 Xbox Wireless headset isn't perfect, but it's the best attempt at being an Xbox gaming headset and an everyday set of wireless headphones I've tried yet. It's compatible with the Xbox Wireless protocol, making it easy to pair with any Xbox One or Xbox Series X / S console. It's also compatible with Bluetooth (version 4.2, SBC codec), and better yet, it can connect through both protocols simultaneously. So you can take a call or have audio from any app come through from a phone, tablet, or a PC mixed in with the sound coming from your Xbox console.
