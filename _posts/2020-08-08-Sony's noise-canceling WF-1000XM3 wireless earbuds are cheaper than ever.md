Sony's wireless, noise-canceling WF-1000XM3 earbuds are down to their most affordable price at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally $230 new, they cost $170. This beats the previous lowest price by around $10. Aside from having good sound quality, one of the main reasons to consider these is that they have fantastic sound isolation with the seal they make in your ear. With this fit, its noise cancellation feature cancels out more disturbances than most other truly wireless earbuds.
