It is increasingly hard to stand out in the wireless earbud market. You can find a pair of earbuds at nearly every price point with a range of different features sprinkled throughout. Being within a particular ecosystem, such as AirPods for iOS users or the Galaxy Buds Live for Samsung's users, is an easy way to choose earbuds that are right for you. Anker doesn't exactly have a phone of its own to sell alongside its Liberty line of earbuds, so its strategy is to deliver desirable features at a competitive price.
