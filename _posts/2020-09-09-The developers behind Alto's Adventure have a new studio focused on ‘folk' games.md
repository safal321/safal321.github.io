As the Alto series grew, so did the team behind it. With Alto's Adventure, the game was made in collaboration between Toronto studio Snowman and English artist and developer Harry Nesbitt. But as the franchise expanded with new platforms and with a sequel, Nesbitt brought on more help. Eventually, they started working under the moniker “Team Alto.” Now, after a lot of soul searching, Nesbitt is announcing the launch of a brand-new studio called Land & Sea, which will continue to work on the series but also develop new titles.
