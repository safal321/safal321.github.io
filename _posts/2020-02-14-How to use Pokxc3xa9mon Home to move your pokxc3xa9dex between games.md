Pokxc3xa9mon Home is a new cloud-based storage service available as an app for Android and iOS phones and tablets, as well as the Nintendo Switch. One of its most alluring features is that it allows you to keep your pokxc3xa9dex handy wherever you might be â€” for a fee. Better yet, it allows you to form a unified pokxc3xa9dex, pulling in the pokxc3xa9mon you've caught in previous games so you can deploy them in, say, Pokxc3xa9mon Sword or Pokxc3xa9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! (Pokxc3xa9mon Go support is still in development for the Home app.)
