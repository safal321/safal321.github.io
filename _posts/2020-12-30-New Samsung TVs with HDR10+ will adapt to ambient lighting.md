HDR10+ Adaptive is a new feature coming to the high dynamic range standard that'll optimize TV picture quality based on a room's ambient brightness, Samsung announced today. HDR content is typically designed to look its best in dark rooms with as little ambient light as possible, but the new feature promises to use your TV's light sensor to react to bright environments and adjust its picture quality accordingly. Samsung says the feature will launch globally with its “upcoming QLED TV products.”
