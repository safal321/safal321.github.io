Bose seems convinced that people really like sunglasses with integrated speakers: today, the company is introducing three new pairs of Frames that follow up on the first two sets it released in 2018. Two are fashion-forward — they're called Tenor and Soprano — and the third set, Tempo, is much more sporty and specifically designed for outdoor use like biking, hiking, and running. (That's the one we spotted in a recent Federal Communications Commission filing.) All three cost the same $249 and are available beginning today; Bose says they're also all prescription-ready.
