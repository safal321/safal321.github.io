Logitech is launching two new gaming audio products that are built for the just-announced Oculus Quest 2. One of them is called the G333, and they're Logitech G's first in-ear headphones pictured above. The other announcement is Logitech's G Pro wired gaming headset, which is an existing product that will now ship with two 3.5mm cables, one that's long and another that's small, suited for when you're using VR. Logitech says it worked with Oculus to ensure that both will deliver a great experience for virtual reality.
