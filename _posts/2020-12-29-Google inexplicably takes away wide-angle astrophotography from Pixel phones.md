Pixel 5 and 4a 5G users can no longer use their ultrawide cameras to take pictures of the stars: Google apparently removed the lens's astrophotography capabilities with the Google Camera 8.1 update. The feature was a selling point of the Pixel 4, and was available on the regular and telephoto cameras. When the 4a 5G and 5 were announced with new wide-angle lenses, the feature was added to those as well. Now it's been taken away.
