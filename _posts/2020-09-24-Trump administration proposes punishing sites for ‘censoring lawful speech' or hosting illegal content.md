The US Department of Justice has submitted a proposal to weaken Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a rule that protects websites and apps from liability for third-party content. The proposal would make it riskier for sites to remove offensive content and would remove sites' immunity for hosting material related to terrorism, child sex abuse, or cyber-stalking. It would also remove some protections for sites that don't sufficiently explain their content moderation policies.
