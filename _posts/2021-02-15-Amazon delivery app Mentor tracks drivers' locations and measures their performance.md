Amazon built its own in-house mobile app called Mentor that it uses to track the location and rate the performance of third-party delivery drivers, according to a new report from CNBC. The app tracks a driver's location at all times and also generates a daily score that factors into performance evaluations, with low scores potentially harming a third-party delivery company's relationship with Amazon for future contracts, the report states.
