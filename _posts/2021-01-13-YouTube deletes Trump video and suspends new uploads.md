YouTube has removed a new video uploaded to President Trump's account for violating the company's content policies. The account has also been issued a “strike” and is unable to upload new content for at least a week. It's presently unclear exactly which video prompted the action on Trump's account, or what it contained. YouTube declined to provide specific details on the video's content.
