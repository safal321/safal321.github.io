Valve is celebrating the anniversary of its launch of Half-Life: Alyx by offering the best price yet on the VR-exclusive game at Steam. Normally $60 (and worth every penny), you can snag it for $36, totaling a 40 percent discount that lasts until Wednesday, March 31st. If you're looking for a new VR game to sink your teeth into, this is worth playing for many reasons. If the fact that is serves as the prequel to Half-Life 2 isn't enough for you, it's the total package for a VR game, with a fantastic narrative and graphics and immersive gameplay that makes a VR headset worth owning.
