Razer has released a swath of products so far during the pandemic, but its new Kiyo Pro might have the widest appeal of them all. It's a new $199 webcam that looks like a lens ripped off a mirrorless camera, aimed to give Logitech's Brio some good competition in the specs department. The four-year-old Brio is still the ideal choice if you value 4K capture and Windows Hello authentication, but the Kiyo Pro is no slouch, capable of streaming or recording 1080p footage at up to 60 frames per second, with an optional HDR mode that displays at 30 frames per second. Razer's new webcam is a more compact alternative, and it has a few other features that might make it worth considering if you want a high-end webcam for more than just joining Zoom calls.
