Playlists on Spotify are often the easiest way to start listening to music, given that the tracklist is already set. Today, the company's giving Premium users more control over what they hear in those playlists, however. Subscribers on iOS and Android can now hide tracks on playlists, meaning if there's one song they hate, they can plan to skip over it before the playlist ever reaches it. They can hide it by going into the “context menu” on the song and selecting “hide song.” Tracks can always be unhidden if listeners change their minds.
