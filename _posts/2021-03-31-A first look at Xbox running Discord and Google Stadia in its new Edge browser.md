Microsoft has started testing a new version of its Edge browser on Xbox consoles. The software giant provided access to the Chromium version of Edge to Xbox Insiders earlier this month, offering an early look at the improved browsing capabilities coming to the Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S. I've had a chance to try out this early version over the past few days, and I've been able to test Discord, Stadia, and other web services running inside Edge on the Xbox. It's like having the full version of Edge from PC running on your TV.
