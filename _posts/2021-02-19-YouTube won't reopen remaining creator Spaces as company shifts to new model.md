YouTube's permanent Spaces locations, which were designed to offer resources and networking opportunities to its creators, won't reopen after the pandemic, the company has confirmed. Instead, YouTube says it's shifting to a hybrid model that will combine pop-up locations with virtual events. The Spaces that won't be re-opening are in Berlin, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rio, and Tokyo.
