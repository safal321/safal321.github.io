Arlo's Video Doorbell is down to $110 at Woot, which is far below its usual $200 price. This smart home gadget released in late 2019, and its standout features are a 1:1 aspect ratio and a wide 180-degree field of view that lets you see what is usually cut off in a doorbell camera feed, like packages that are being dropped off. Many video doorbells from Ring, Nest, and other brands use a 16:9 aspect ratio that tends to obscure what's below the knees, making it all but necessary to go outside to see what has been delivered.
