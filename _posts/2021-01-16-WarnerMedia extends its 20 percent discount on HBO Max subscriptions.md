A discount on HBO Max that was supposed to end today, January 15th, has been extended until March 1st, 2021. The fine print of the offer hasn't changed: you can get six months of HBO Max for 20 percent off the normal total cost, which is usually $90 before tax. You'll pay $70 with this deal (it's like paying just under $12 per month instead of $15), but the catch is that you have to prepay in full and it's nonrefundable.
