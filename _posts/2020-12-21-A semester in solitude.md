Georgina DiNardo's first virtual class is at 9:45. It's Introduction To Communications — she's a TA, so she's responsible for sharing her computer screen with the class to display articles and other visual aids. At 11, she has a short break — she walks around the room to stretch her legs. By 11:20, she's back on Zoom for a macroeconomics class (as a student, this time). For the rest of the afternoon, she edits and writes for The Eagle, American University's newspaper, communicating with her colleagues in a pile of Slack channels. Then, homework.
