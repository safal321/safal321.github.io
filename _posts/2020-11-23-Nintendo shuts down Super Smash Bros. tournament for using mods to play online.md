A major Super Smash Bros. tournament is canceling plans to move online amid the coronavirus pandemic, following a legal order by Nintendo. As Polygon reports, The Big House — typically one of the year's biggest Smash competitions — announced yesterday that it's shutting down its early December event and offering refunds. “The Big House is heartbroken to share we've received a cease and desist from Nintendo,” the organizers wrote on Twitter. “We are forced to comply with the order and cancel The Big House Online.”
