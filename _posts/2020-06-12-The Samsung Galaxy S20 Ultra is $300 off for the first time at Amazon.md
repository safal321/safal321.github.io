Samsung's Galaxy S20 Ultra is $300 off for the first time at Amazon. This phone usually costs $1,400, and today's sale brings it down to $1,100, less than the regular price of the Galaxy S20 Plus. Sure, that's still a tremendous amount of cash to spend on a phone, but this is the best opportunity yet to save a lot on an unlocked version of the S20 Ultra. This phone has a big 6.9-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, the Snapdragon 865, and a 40-megapixel selfie cam, among other high-end specs.
