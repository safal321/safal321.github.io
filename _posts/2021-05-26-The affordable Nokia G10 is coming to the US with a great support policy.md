HMD's Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a big battery, a low $149 price, and a surprisingly good security support schedule. Phone Arena reports that the G10 — available for preorder now at Amazon — will go on sale directly through Nokia's website later this week. The G10 was first announced in Europe last month alongside five other midrange devices.
