Samsung is unveiling its latest foldable Galaxy Z Flip phone today. It looks a lot different than the troubled Galaxy Fold, and it folds up much like the new Motorola Razr. It's clearly designed to be a full phone with a 6.7-inch display that folds and shrinks into a much smaller square when it's closed. Think of it as a tiny phone that slips into a pocket or bag and can be folded out like a regular flip phone.
