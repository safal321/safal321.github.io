Nikon just announced a delay of its D6 camera for professional sports photographers. The company originally planned for a March release, but that's been pushed back to sometime in May due to a shortage of components caused by actions taken to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The camera is expected to be a big seller ahead of the summer Olympic games in Tokyo scheduled to begin in July.
