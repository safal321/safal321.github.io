A consumer advocacy group in Europe has filed the latest lawsuit against Apple saying the company intentionally throttled older iPhones in Italy. First reported by TechCrunch, the potential class-action lawsuit seeks xe2x82xac60 million (roughly $73 million) in compensation — or about xe2x82xac60 per device — for owners of iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus models sold in Italy between 2014 and 2020. Euroconsumers, an umbrella advocacy organization in the EU that includes Italy's Altroconsumo, says the xe2x82xac60 compensation is the average amount consumers paid to replace their devices' batteries.
