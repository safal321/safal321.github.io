For the past month, I've been testing the two most powerful Wear OS watches you can buy: the TicWatch Pro 3 from Mobvoi and the Fossil Gen 5 LTE. They're not spec-for-spec identical, but they do share a basic shape: big, chunky, round, and black. If you're using Android and want a smartwatch, they're at the top of a persistently tiny list of top-flight smartwatches.
