Apple has introduced the new M1 chip that will power its new generation of Arm-based Macs. It's a 5nm processor, just like the A14 Bionic powering its latest iPhones, but it's the first that Apple has designed specifically for the Mac. The new chip will power Apple's new MacBook Air, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro, the latter of which offers the “longest battery life ever in a Mac” according to Apple.
