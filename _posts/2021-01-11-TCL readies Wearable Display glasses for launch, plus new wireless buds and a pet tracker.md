For CES 2021, TCL is showing off a wearable display prototype that's been in the works for years and is now close to reaching market. Simply enough, the company is calling it the TCL Wearable Display, and it's a pair of glasses with two 1080p mini OLED screens on the inside. This isn't a virtual reality headset â€” rather it's a new take on the concept of a wearable, personal display that gives the viewer the effect of looking at a very large screen.
