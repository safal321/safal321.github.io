Tomorrow is Mother's Day, and while the ongoing pandemic continues to be a nuisance that is probably preventing you from making special plans this year, you can still pick up a nice gift for a mom in your life. One of those gifts ideas is a DJI Osmo Mobile 3 gimbal to stabilize footage recorded on a phone, whether mom likes to shoot in vertical or horizontal mode. These come in a special pre-wrapped Mother's Day bundle right now directly from DJI for $139.
