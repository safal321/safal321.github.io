The $399 Ultimate Ears HyperBoom Bluetooth speaker is one of my favorite gadgets of 2020. It has great sound quality, near-360-degree sound delivery, long-lasting battery life, and elegant design â€” everything you can expect from the company's previous models, but far bigger in size and power. This speaker's measurements are somewhat similar to the Xbox Series X (the HyperBoom has about 2.5 inches in height and 1.5 inches in thickness on the next-gen console, according to this Polygon post), though it weighs a whopping 13 pounds.
