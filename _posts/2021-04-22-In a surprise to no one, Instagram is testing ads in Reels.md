Instagram puts ads just about everywhere in its app, and now, they're coming to Reels. The company says today it'll start testing ads in its TikTok copy product in India, Brazil, Germany, and Australia. The plan is to then expand that group in the coming months. The ads can be up to 30 seconds long, like Reels, and will look similar to the ones you see in stories in that they're vertical and full-screen. Unlike those story ads, though, people can comment on, like, view, save, share, and skip them in Reels.
