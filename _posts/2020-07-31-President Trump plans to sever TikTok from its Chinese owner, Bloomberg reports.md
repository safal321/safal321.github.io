President Donald Trump intends to sign an order that would direct Bytedance to sell its ownership of the US-based video-sharing app TikTok, according to Bloomberg. The order, which could be announced as soon as Friday afternoon, would employ the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to force Bytedance to divest, similar to the process undertaken against Grindr's Chinese investors last year.
