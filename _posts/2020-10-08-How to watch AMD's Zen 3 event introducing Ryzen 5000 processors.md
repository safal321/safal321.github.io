With the proclamation that “a new journey begins,” AMD is announcing its new lineup of Ryzen 5000 processors for desktops, featuring its new Zen 3 architecture. The new chips are, if you go by AMD's website, going to be focused specifically on gaming and content creation and could be a powerful new competitor to Intel's 10th gen desktop lineup. (Intel's 11th gen desktop chips won't arrive till 2021.)
