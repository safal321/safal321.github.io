Father's Day in the US is coming up on Sunday, June 21st. That's next week, so you still have time to do some shopping. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic still has many retail stores shuttered, we recommend doing most of your shopping for dad online. Though, if you're running short on time to buy a gift, you might be able to arrange a curbside pickup depending on the store.
