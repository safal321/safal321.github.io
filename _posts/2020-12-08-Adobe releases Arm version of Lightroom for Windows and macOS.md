Adobe is releasing an Arm version of Lightroom for both macOS and Windows today. The latest version of Lightroom is now native for both Apple M1 systems and Qualcomm-powered Windows 10 devices. It's debuting as a full release, rather than a beta version and Adobe is making it part of the regular Creative Suite installer.
