Logitech is unveiling a new version of its Circle security camera today called the Circle View. Spec-wise, it's nearly identical to its predecessor, the Circle 2, but the camera's housing has been completely redesigned and it now relies on Apple's smart home system to function. This generation of the security camera is a lot more straightforward, which means less flexibility overall, but it's something that should be easier to just plug in and start using.
