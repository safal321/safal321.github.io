Acer's Predator Triton 300 SE is chasing after the hype that Asus built with last year's excellent Zephyrus G14. It's similar in a few key ways: it's a sophisticated-looking gaming laptop bordering on ultrabook territory in terms of its sleek and relatively thin design. It has a 14-inch 1080p display with a fast refresh rate and respectable graphics capabilities to top it off. Even its price hits a similar spot at $1,399.
