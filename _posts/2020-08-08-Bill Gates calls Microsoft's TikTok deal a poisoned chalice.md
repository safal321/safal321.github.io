Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has described the company's potential TikTok deal as a poisoned chalice. In a wide-ranging interview with Wired, Gates makes it clear that Microsoft acquiring parts of TikTok won't be easy or simple. “Who knows what's going to happen with that deal,” says Gates. “But yes, it's a poison[ed] chalice.” He also notes that being a big player in the social media business “is no simple game,” as Microsoft will have to contend with a whole new level of content moderation.
