You might want to change your Slack password if you used the app on Android. According to an email sent out by the company and published by Android Police, the Android version of the Slack app stored users' credentials in plain text between December 21st and January 21st, theoretically meaning other apps on your phone could have had access to them. Slack  says it hasn't seen any unauthorized access, and that it's already emailed all affected users and invalidated their passwords â€” so if you had to enter in a new password when you opened the app, that could be why.
