Amazon and the Women's National Basketball Association have announced a multi-year deal that'll see several games streamed live on Prime Video. It's the first time Amazon has ever secured exclusive Prime Video rights to pro basketball, following earlier forays into streaming sports content like Thursday Night Football and certain Premier League games. Amazon's Twitch has also partnered with USA Basketball to stream international games from events like the FIBA World Cup.
