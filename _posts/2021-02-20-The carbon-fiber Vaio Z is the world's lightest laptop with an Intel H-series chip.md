Vaio is known for making laptops that pack a surprising amount of power into unbelievably thin form factors. The Vaio Z may be the company's most ambitious product yet. It contains up to Intel's four-core Core i7-11357H â€” and at a starting weight of 2.11 pounds, it'll be the lightest laptop ever to house an Intel H-series processor. (Though models you can buy in the US are 2.32 pounds.)
