The Oculus Quest untethered virtual reality headset is available on Oculus' website. The ship date at the time of publishing is March 16th. This model, along with many other VR headsets, has been out of stock for the past few months â€” in part due to the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on manufacturing. It's unclear if this is a sign that availability is returning to normal or if this is a limited supply. Valve recently sold through a limited amount of its Index virtual reality headset on Monday.
