Verizon has sold its AOL and Yahoo properties to Apollo Global Management in a deal said to be worth $5 billion, about half of the nearly $9 billion Verizon originally paid for the pair. Verizon will maintain a 10 percent stake in the company, now known as Yahoo and led by CEO Guru Gowrappan. The deal, which includes Verizon's ad tech business, was heavily rumored over the last week and is still subject to closing conditions. Once complete, it'll bring an end to Verizon's troubled experiment with media production and advertising.
