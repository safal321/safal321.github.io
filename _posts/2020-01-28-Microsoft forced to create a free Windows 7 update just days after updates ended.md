Microsoft released its final public security updates for Windows 7 earlier this month, ending support for the operating system after more than 10 years. While the final updates looked pretty routine, Microsoft has now revealed that one is causing wallpaper issues for some Windows 7 users. “After installing KB4534310, your desktop wallpaper might display as black when set to Stretch,” admits Microsoft. It seems to only be affecting stretched wallpapers, and fit, fill, tile, or center options are still working for Windows 7 users.
