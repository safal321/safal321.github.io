Amazon's fall Alexa hardware event is scheduled for September 24th at 1PM ET. It's not clear exactly what might be revealed at the event — an invite sent to The Verge only said that Amazon's Devices and Services team would be sharing “some news.” An Amazon spokesperson specified that the event is invite-only, however, which suggests it won't be live streamed for the public.
