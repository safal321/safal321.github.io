You can catch up on all of the Witcher games on PC, and snag a preorder copy of Cyberpunk 2077 for $88 altogether at GOG.com. This special bundle is called the Ultimate RED collection, as it's a slate of developer CD Projekt Red's titles. If you were planning to preorder its upcoming Cyberpunk 2077, this is a good way to keep yourself busy until it launches in November. Just to note, these games are DRM-free and don't require Steam or any other game platform to run.
