The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Tesla to recall some 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles that could suffer from failing display consoles, according to a letter published by the agency on Wednesday. The failures of the so-called “media control units” in these vehicles can sever the owner's access to their vehicle's backup camera, climate controls, and Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system, increasing the risk of a crash, the safety agency says.
