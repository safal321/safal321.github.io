iBuyPower announced a new 18.34-liter small form factor PC case at CES 2021 called the Revolt 3 MK3. I'm not sure what I find so enthralling about it, but it's the kind of case I'd find myself staring at for an embarrassing amount of time if I were in the market to upgrade my build. (Maybe I am, after all.) If you're a fan of minimalist cases like me, with next to no added LEDs, you might find yourself under the spell of this case, too.
