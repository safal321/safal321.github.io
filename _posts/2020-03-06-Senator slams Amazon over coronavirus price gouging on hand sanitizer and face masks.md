US Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) is harshly criticizing what he sees as Amazon's inconsistent response to ongoing coronavirus-related price gouging on the e-commerce company's third-party Marketplace platform. While Markey is acknowledging that Amazon is indeed removing an ever-increasing number of listings, he said Wednesday in a new letter to CEO Jeff Bezos that Amazon's response needs to improve. He's chiefly concerned about the lack of transparency around how it determines a product is having its prices unfairly raised and the process Amazon undergoes to detect that and then take action.
