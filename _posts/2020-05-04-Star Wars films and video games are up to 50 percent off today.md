It's May 4th, which means that there are plenty of Star Wars-themed deals out there today. We've settled on covering just a few discounts on acclaimed video games and movies, though, of course, there's also some merchandise you can score if you're in the mood. My colleague Kim Lyons wrote about Disney's new four-pack of Star Wars face masks that are available for preorder.
