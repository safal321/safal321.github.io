Day two of Amazon Prime Day 2020 is underway, and you have until later tonight at 12AM PT / 3AM ET to get in on all of the deals. If you were shopping the Prime Day deals yesterday, you likely saw hefty price cuts on must-have products, like Sony's WH-1000XM4 wireless noise-canceling headphones, AirPods wireless earbuds, tablets, and more.
