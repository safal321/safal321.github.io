The OnePlus 9 is a very good phone that holds its own against other (often more expensive) flagships. It has all the things that truly matter: a great screen, excellent performance, good battery life, and a capable camera. But for better or worse, it still doesn't feel quite like a device that's well-suited for the mainstream. It misses a couple of features present on the competition like a stabilized main camera and broad 5G support.
