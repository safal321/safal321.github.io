If you live in one of the twelve states where Comcast is planning to roll out 1.2TB data caps, we have some moderately good news: you won't have to start monitoring your bill for extra charges until July. The ISP had planned to start charging customers $10-and-up fees for using more than 1.2TB of data starting this March, but the rollout has been delayed (via The Washington Post). This gives us a few more months until the scourge of Comcast home internet data caps are truly nationwide.
