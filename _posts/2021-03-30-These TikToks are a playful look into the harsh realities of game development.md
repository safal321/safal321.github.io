Leslee Sullivant approaches the camera curiously. Her hair is pulled back into a ponytail, and she's dressed in an olive green button-up against a bar background. “Are you one of the new hires?” she asks. “Oh, you're the intern!” She offers to sneak you a drink when she learns you're underage and asks about your boyfriend. You're not like her wife, she says. The wife doesn't really get the whole gaming thing. “If you're looking for a mentor, I'm your guy,” she concludes. The caption on the TikTok video is “grooming.”
