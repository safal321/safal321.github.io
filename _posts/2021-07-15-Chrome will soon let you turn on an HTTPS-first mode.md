Google is working to make browsing more secure by soon offering an HTTPS-first option, which will try to upgrade page loads to HTTPS, the company announced on Wednesday. If you flip this option on, the browser will also show a full-page warning when you try to load up a site that doesn't support HTTPS. The company is also announcing that it's “re-examining” the lock icon in the URL bar and plans to experiment with a change to how that looks.
