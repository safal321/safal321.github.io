Pac-Man will be a playable game on Twitch starting this June, Bandai Namco and Amazon Games announced today. To play the Twitch version of the game, called Pac-Man Live Studio, you'll just need to navigate to the dedicated Twitch channel for the game when it goes live, though you'll only be able to play it on a web browser.
