Bloomberg has published a new report detailing much of Apple's product roadmap for 2020, including the four new iPhones that have been widely rumored. Corroborating Ming-chi Kuo's analysis from last year, Apple is said to be redesigning the iPhone Pro chassis with flat edges reminiscent of the current iPad Pro.
