Warner Bros' new animated Scooby-Doo movie Scoob! has become the latest major film to skip its theatrical release as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic forces cinemas to remain closed. Variety reports that the film will be available to rent or buy on May 15th, the same day as it was originally due to open in theatres. You'll be able to rent it for $19.99, or buy it for $24.99, but the Associated Press notes that the film will not immediately be available to stream as part of Warner Bros HBO Max service.
