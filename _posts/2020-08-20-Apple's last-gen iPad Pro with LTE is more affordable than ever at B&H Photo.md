If you're looking to upgrade your iPad but don't necessarily need the latest or most powerful version of the iPad Pro, you can save a lot of money on the previous generation of the iPad Pro from 2018 for a limited time. It's steeply discounted, and what's better, this model includes support for 4G LTE in addition to Wi-Fi, which is handy if you're on the go and want to stick a SIM card into it.
