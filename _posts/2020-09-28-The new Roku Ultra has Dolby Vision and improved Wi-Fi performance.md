It's fall, so that means it's time for the annual refresh of Roku hardware. In addition to the Streambar announced today, the company's streaming player lineup is led by a refreshed Roku Ultra. For the first time, the flagship device now supports Dolby Vision HDR. Many Roku TVs already offer the format, but so far Roku's standalone devices have not. (They've had Dolby Atmos audio, however, which the Ultra retains.) The company is also adding support for the AV1 codec, which video platforms are increasingly starting to adopt.
