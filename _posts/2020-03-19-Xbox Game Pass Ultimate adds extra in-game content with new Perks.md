Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers are getting new in-game content as part of their subscription, Microsoft has announced. The new “Perks” vary by game, but they range from unique emotes and in-game cosmetic items in Phantasy Star Online 2 to free ship parts in Sea of Thieves. World of Tanks: Mercenaries players, meanwhile, will get access to three tanks, or you can get a bundle of five Gods, character skins, and voice packs in Smite.
