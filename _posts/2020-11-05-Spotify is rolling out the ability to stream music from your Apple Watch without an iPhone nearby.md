Spotify is rolling out the ability to stream music right from your Apple Watch, the company confirmed to The Verge. Since the app's launch in 2018, the Apple Watch worked primarily as a remote for Spotify music playing on an iPhone or Spotify Connect-compatible device. But once the new feature is rolled out to you, you'll be able to stream music from Spotify on your Apple Watch to Bluetooth headphones or speakers when you're not near your phone.
