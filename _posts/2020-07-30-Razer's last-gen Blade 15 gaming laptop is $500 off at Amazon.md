Razer's Blade 15 gaming laptop is $500 off at Amazon, dropping the price to a very reasonable $1,100. This machine is its previous-generation model, which affects the overall design and internal components only in a few minor ways that might not matter to you if you're just looking for a well-crafted, feature-packed Windows 10 machine. First off, it has Intel's 9th Gen Core i7-9750H, but it likely won't show its age since it's a six-core processor that's fairly new. More pressing is that the keyboard is Razer's older design that wedged the up arrow between the forward slash and right Shift keys. I find that arrangement to be annoying, but not necessarily a deal-breaker. Also not so great is the small 256GB NVMe M.2 SSD that comes built-in, but you can upgrade to a much larger one for a good price and install it yourself.
