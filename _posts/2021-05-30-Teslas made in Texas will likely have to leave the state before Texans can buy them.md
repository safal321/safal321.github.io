Tesla is building a factory in Texas to make some of its cars, but when it's up and running, the cars made there may have to go on a roundabout journey to get to Texan buyers (via The Drive). Because of state laws banning car companies from selling directly to consumers, Tesla could end up shipping the cars from its Austin factory to other states, before they're sent back to their Texan buyers. The state's lawmakers were debating legislation that would have prevented the situation, but they've now missed their chance to pass it before they have to go on break until 2023 â€” the factory is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.
