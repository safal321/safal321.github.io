Ubisoft entered the crowded battle royale market yesterday with Hyper Scape, a new first-person shooter promising a unique twist on the crowded formula. Ahead of its release, the game looked like it had potential to be a big hit on Twitch, even topping the streaming giant's most-viewed charts the day it was announced and its technical test first went live. Sadly, the hype for Ubisoft's futuristic free-to-play game has fallen off significantly, as it's now pulling in abysmal viewership just one day after release on console and PC.
