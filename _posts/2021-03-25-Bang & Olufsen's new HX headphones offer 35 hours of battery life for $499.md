Bang & Olufsen's latest pair of headphones are the Beoplay HX. They're over-ear, noise canceling, and offer up to a truly impressive 35 hours of battery life. The headphones launch in black today for $499 (xc2xa3499 / xe2x82xac499), but there's a white model coming at the end of April, to be followed by a white and brown version in May.
