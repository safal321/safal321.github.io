If you ask me, $300 for a QHD gaming monitor that has Nvidia's G-Sync compatibility and a fantastic IPS panel is a great price. That's how much LG's UltraGear 27-inch QHD model costs â€” down $100 from its usual price at B&H Photo and Amazon. This monitor has a subtle design and slim bezels, and in terms of features, it has a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and covers 99 percent of the sRGB color spectrum. In terms of ports, it has two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm output for desktop speakers or headphones.
