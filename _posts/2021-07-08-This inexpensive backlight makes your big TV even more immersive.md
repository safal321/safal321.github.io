I've been intrigued by Philips' Ambilight televisions for almost two decades. Watching those displays bleed onto the wall in radiant synchronicity is something to behold. I just couldn't justify the price premium, despite the promise of a more immersive viewing experience. Then Philips Hue introduced an external Hue Play Box that adds Ambilight to any TV. But at $229 and requiring you to buy lights to use with it, it was still too expensive for my cheap ass.
