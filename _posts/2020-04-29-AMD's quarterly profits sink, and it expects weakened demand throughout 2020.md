AMD posted its Q1 2020 financial results, and quarter-to-quarter revenue is down by 16 percent. Its quarterly operating income also took a dive, as revenue slowed and R&D costs went up. On the bright side, it shared that its $1.79 billion year-to-year revenue is up 40 percent compared to this time in 2020. It attributes this big jump to its computing and graphics segments, including its Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics cards â€” both of which have gotten major updates recently.
