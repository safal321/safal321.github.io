Jimmy Choi's TikTok page is filled with the typical videos of a high-level athlete: clips of himself doing one-armed pushups, climbing ropes, holding planks with weights on his back. If you look closely, though, you'll notice that even before he begins his feats of strength and endurance, his hands are shaking. Choi has Parkinson's disease, a central nervous system disorder that causes tremors, and he often posts about what it's like to live with the disease.
