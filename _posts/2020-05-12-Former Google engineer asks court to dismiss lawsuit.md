Former Google engineer James Damore, who sued Google in 2018 for allegedly discriminating against conservative white men, has asked a court to dismiss the suit, Bloomberg reported. The written request by Damore and three other men who joined his suit also was joined by Google. Damore's attorney said as part of an agreement with Google the men are barred from speaking about the case beyond the Thursday filing in Santa Clara Superior Court, according to Bloomberg.
