LG has officially announced a portable air purifier that you wear on your face like a mask. The PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier uses a pair of replaceable filters similar to what you'd find in LG's range of air purifiers for the home, pairing them with battery-powered fans to help you breath. LG says the device has sensors to detect when you're breathing in or out, and adjusts the fans' speeds accordingly.
