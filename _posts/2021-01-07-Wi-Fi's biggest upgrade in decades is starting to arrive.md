Wi-Fi is about to get a lot better. Many of this year's new phones, laptops, TVs, routers, and more will come with support for Wi-Fi 6E, a new upgrade to Wi-Fi that's essentially like expanding your wireless connection from a two-lane road to an eight-lane highway. It's the biggest upgrade to Wi-Fi in 20 years, and connections should be faster and a lot more reliable because of it.
