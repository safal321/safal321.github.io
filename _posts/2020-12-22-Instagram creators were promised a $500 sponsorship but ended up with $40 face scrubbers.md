All of the women tell the same story of how they were scammed. A company called The SkinGlo emailed them with a tempting deal: it was looking for content to fill its Instagram feed, and its team had chosen them to help. In exchange for five photos of them using The SkinGlo's electric face scrubber — even photos taken just from their phones — they'd receive xe2x82xac450, or about $525 USD. They could even watermark the images and only send over a clean file once they got paid. It seemed like a good deal.
