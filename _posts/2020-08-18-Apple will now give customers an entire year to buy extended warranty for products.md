Apple is yet again making changes to the window of time customers have to buy its AppleCare+ extended warranty for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other products. According to Bloomberg, the company has stretched the eligibility for AppleCare+ to an entire year after the purchase of whatever device you're covering. Retail staff and customer support staff were informed of the change on Monday, though Apple's website still doesn't reflect any update.
