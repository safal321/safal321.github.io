Asus has announced a new fanless addition to its family of Chromeboxes: the Asus Fanless Chromebox. Like Asus' previous models, the Fanless Chromebox's compact size is designed to be mounted to the back of a display or desk to save space in size-conscious work environments. Perhaps unintentionally, it also looks almost exactly like a wireless router.
