This is the first time in recent memory where several deals we've written about through the week are still available. It's always great when readers have an extended window of time to snag a deal. So, below you'll find a few of our favorite picks from the week, along with one new exclusive deal for Verge readers. I won't keep you in suspense, it's on the Pixel 5. We worked with a partner to secure some refurbished units that are in great condition.
