There's a good deal happening on Western Digital's WD_Black SN750 NVMe M.2 drive with 500GB of storage. It usually floats around $80, but it's $63 right now at Amazon, B&H Photo, and even at Western Digital's online store. 500GB is admittedly not a lot of storage, but if you're in a pinch for something fast and don't require a bunch of extra space, this is worth checking out.
