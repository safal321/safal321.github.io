Western Digital's 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD with PCIe 4.0 support in compatible motherboards is cheaper than ever at B&H Photo and the company's own site. It originally sold for $230, but you can get one now for $180. There are cheaper SSDs that have 1TB of storage, but this is a good deal if you want an SSD that's capable of far faster transfer speeds than most others. Western Digital claims it can achieve up to 7,000MB/s read speeds and 5,300MB/s write speeds when it's mounted into a motherboard that supports PCIe 4.0, which only a few do at this point. But it'll work in any motherboard with an M.2 slot, just not at those aforementioned speeds.
