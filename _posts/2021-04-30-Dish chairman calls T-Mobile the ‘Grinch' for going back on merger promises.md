Today's Dish Network Q1 earnings call took an unexpected turn into Whoville when chairman Charlie Ergen compared T-Mobile to the Grinch. The comparison came up when discussing the “Uncarrier's” decision to go ahead with its CDMA shutdown, a move that will potentially see millions of Dish's Boost Mobile customers losing service at the beginning of next year. Ergen made no secret what he thinks of the move: “They've become the Grinch.” He went on to add, “the Uncarrier's become the uncaring carrier.”
