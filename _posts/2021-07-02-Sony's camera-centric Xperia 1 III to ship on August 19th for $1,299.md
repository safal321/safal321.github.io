Sony's next flagship phone, the Xperia 1 III, will ship on August 19th in the US — for a whopping $1,299.99. It's available to preorder today, the company announced. The new photography-focused phone is designed as a complement to Sony's Alpha camera range, and it introduces a variable periscope-style telephoto lens. It's also equipped with just about everything you'd expect from a flagship Android phone in 2021, including a Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G, and a 6.5-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate.
