Microsoft has thoroughly convinced me: I don't need to buy an Xbox Series X. The games don't look “next-gen” enough. There aren't enough titles I actually want to play. Yesterday, the company announced its flagship game, Halo Infinite, won't even arrive until 2021. Besides, almost all of Microsoft's key games are also coming to Windows PCs, and some may even come to the PS5 as well. And while I have a sneaking suspicion that Microsoft is breaking a big promise by not bringing some Xbox Series X games to the Xbox One, another possibility is that many of the biggest reasons to buy a new Xbox won't be available until long after its November launch.
