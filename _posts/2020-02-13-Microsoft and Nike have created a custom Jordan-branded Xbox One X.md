Microsoft loves creating custom Xbox One designs, and this time, it has partnered with Nike to introduce a Jordan-themed console. The Xbox One X includes a custom red finish, with the iconic Jordan elephant print covering the top part of the console. There's even a matching red controller with the Jumpman logo.
