The Evercade handheld that released in 2020 can connect to your TV through its Mini HDMI port, but its 4.3-inch screen proves it was designed more for retro gaming on the go. Now, there's a version of the Evercade just for your TV. It's called the Evercade VS, and it can output retro games at 1080p, delivering “top-of-the-line emulation,” with support for up to four wired USB controllers for multiplayer in games. It'll cost $99.99 when it launches on November 3rd, 2021, and preorders start on May 28th, 2021.
