I picked up a new MacBook Air with Apple's M1 chip, and I've absolutely loved it so far. It's really speedy and the battery is fantastic. But I've been dealing with one nagging issue. Every once in a while, for reasons that I haven't been able to figure out, a screensaver will suddenly take over the entire computer â€” despite the fact that I never use a screensaver. And frustratingly, the screensaver renders my laptop inoperable until I completely close the screen and reopen it.
