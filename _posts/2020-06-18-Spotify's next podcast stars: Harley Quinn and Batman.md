Spotify has a new podcast deal that'll allow it to make narrative shows around DC Comics characters, like Batman and Harley Quinn. The company announced the multi-year, first-look licensing deal with WarnerMedia, which owns DC Comics, this morning, giving Spotify another group of exclusive podcasts to add to its catalog. The agreement means Spotify can produce, market, distribute, and sell ads against podcasts built around DC Comics IP. Although the company didn't detail the agreement, it's likely Warner is making money not just off the licensing but also the ads that'll show up in the shows. Spotify hasn't yet released details on the programs and casting.
