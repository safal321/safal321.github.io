Woot is offering the iPhone XS Max at its lowest price yet. You can pick up a new model in space gray with 64GB for $700. This is 30 percent off of its usual price, and if you're keen on having the latest-generation iPhone, it's a good way to save. The 2018 iPhone XS Max has a big 6.5-inch OLED screen, and it's powered by the A12 Bionic processor. The version that Woot is selling is unlocked to work with any US carrier.
