One assumption that many of us had about the 2020 US presidential election is that, at some point, it would end. This may have been overly optimistic; after all, in many ways — and certainly in this column — the 2016 US presidential election never really ended. We spent four (productive!) years discussing the degree to which foreign interference, particularly on social platforms, had affected the outcome. I imagine we'll continue discussing it for some time to come.
