Twitch is bigger than it's ever been before. The site's viewership increased a full 31 percent between March 8th and March 22nd, growing to 43 million hours watched from 33 million hours, according to data from Stream Elements and Arsenal.gg. There's also been a concurrent growth in streamers joining the platform: musicians joined en masse after their tours were canceled in a search for replacement revenue, and now, over the same period of time, hours watched of the music and performing arts category on Twitch soared to more than 574,000 hours, up from 92,000 hours. Something is happening.
