Amazon is not pleased with the decision from the Trump administration to list a number of its foreign websites as havens for counterfeit products in its annual report on “notorious markets” released Wednesday. The report, which looks into intellectual property protection and hot spots for counterfeiting and piracy, put Amazon's Canada, UK, Germany, France, and India websites on the list as online markets for knockoff goods. It's the first time a US business has been put on the notorious markets list.
