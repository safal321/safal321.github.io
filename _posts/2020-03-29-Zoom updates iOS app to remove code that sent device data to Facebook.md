Video conferencing app Zoom updated its iOS app Friday to remove code that sent user data to Facebook, Motherboard reports. The update follows Motherboard's analysis of the app, which showed it was sending data to Facebook such as a user's time zone and city, when a user opened the app, and details about the user's device, even if the user didn't have a Facebook account. The extent of the data-sharing was not clearly spelled out in Zoom's privacy policy, according to Motherboard.
