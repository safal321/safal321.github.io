Now that Microsoft has announced Windows 11, you may be wondering what you'll need to install it. Confirming information pulled from last week's leak, all you'll need to run it is a 64-bit CPU (or SoC), 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, specs that are only slightly higher than Windows 10's current requirements. This marks the end of Windows support for older 32-bit hardware platforms, even though it will continue to run 32-bit software.
