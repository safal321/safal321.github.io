One year after Disney shut its doors indefinitely, laying off tens of thousands of staff, Disneyland will reopen on April 30th, the company announced today. That's four days before Star Wars Day (“May the Fourth”) and apparently just in time for fans to grab the elusive Galaxy's Edge spork. (The flagship “Rise of the Resistance” ride also barely opened at Disneyland's Galaxy's Edge before the pandemic began, so expect that to be popular.)
