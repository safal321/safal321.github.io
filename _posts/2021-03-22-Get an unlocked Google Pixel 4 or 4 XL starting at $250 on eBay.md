A well-rated eBay seller is offering the Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL phones at very reasonable prices for a limited time. The Pixel 4 in white with 64GB of storage costs $250, while the larger Pixel 4 XL in black with the same amount of storage costs $280. Each of these phones will arrive factory unlocked and be usable with most carriers that support 4G LTE. They're in new / open-box condition, which the seller indicates as meaning the phones show no signs of wear.
