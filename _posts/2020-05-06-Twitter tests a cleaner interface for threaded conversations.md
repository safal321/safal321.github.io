Twitter is showing some iOS and web users a new interface to make it easier to follow threaded conversations, the company has announced. A gif published by Twitter's Support account shows the new test interface in action, with lines and indents making it much easier to see who's responding to who in a Twitter thread. The functionality first came to Twitter's prototype app twttr last year, and builds upon the iOS update released back in January.
