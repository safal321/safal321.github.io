Facebook says Oculus Rift S headsets “generally” won't be replenished as they disappear from store shelves, marking the end of the virtual reality system's life span. As UploadVR reported yesterday, Facebook has confirmed that “generally speaking, as channels sell out of stock, they won't be replenished moving forward.” The PC-tethered headset is unavailable through Oculus' store, and it's out of stock on retail platforms like Amazon and Walmart in the US, except from third-party sellers.
