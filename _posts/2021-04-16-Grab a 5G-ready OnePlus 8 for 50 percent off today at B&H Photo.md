B&H Photo is once again offering the lowest price yet on the Verizon variant of the OnePlus 8. Originally priced at $800, you can get this model for $400. This phone typically costs more than the original OnePlus 8 model because it is compatible with Verizon's mmWave network. However, because B&H is selling it as unlocked, it will work on AT&T and T-Mobile networks if either is your preferred phone carrier.
