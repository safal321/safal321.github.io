If you're trying to get some holiday (or personal) shopping done ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, this week hosted several great deals on wireless earbuds, tablets, and more that are still happening. Apple's ever-popular and reliable AirPods fell to $100 for the first time (they're usually around $130), which is the most affordable price we've seen. Both Amazon and Costco are offering the deal, if you're interested in snagging a set.
