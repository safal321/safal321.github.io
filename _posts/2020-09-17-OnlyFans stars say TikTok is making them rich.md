Lee thanks TikTok, an app she barely knew about five months ago, for her newfound status as a six-figure earner. She lived a relatively average life up until recently: she worked a retail job on the East Coast, shared an apartment with roommates, and, by all standards, was a regular 20-year-old. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March, she, like many others, joined TikTok and posted videos of herself doing “random” things, like putting on makeup, showing off her height (below 5 feet), and dancing. People seemed to enjoy it.
