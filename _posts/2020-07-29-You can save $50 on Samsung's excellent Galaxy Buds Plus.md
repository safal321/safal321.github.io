We recently ranked Samsung's Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds as the best overall option, thanks to their 11-hour continuous battery life, wireless charging support, improved microphones, and excellent sound quality. They normally cost $150, but you can grab them for just shy of $100 from a reputable seller at eBay. If you're okay with getting them in white, which has a pearlescent look, they cost $99, though the black or blue options are $110.
