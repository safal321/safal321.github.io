Musicians aren't thrilled with Spotify â€” they say the streaming platform undervalues their work and they deserve to be paid more per stream. So today, Spotify's trying to address those concerns with a new website called Loud & Clear, which offers more insight into how much the platform pays artists and how that money is distributed. The site also includes a calculator so artists can see where their work ranks on Spotify, like how a song with 100,000 all-time streams would only be in the top 2,710,000 tracks on the platform.
