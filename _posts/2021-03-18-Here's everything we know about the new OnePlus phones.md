OnePlus has an upcoming event on March 23rd, where it'll be formally announcing the OnePlus 9, and OnePlus 9 Pro. As with any smartphone event these days, there's a ton of information about what will be revealed at the event, thanks in no small part to OnePlus itself doling out pieces of news over the past couple of weeks.
