Acer has refreshed its lineup of Predator Helios and Triton gaming laptops with support for powerful, new components like Intel's 10th Gen H-series processors and Nvidia's RTX 2070 and 2080 Super Max-Q graphics chips. There are also some updates coming to the less expensive Nitro lineup, and a very impressive gaming monitor has been announced. The products may differ, but fast refresh rates seem to be the theme tying them all together.
