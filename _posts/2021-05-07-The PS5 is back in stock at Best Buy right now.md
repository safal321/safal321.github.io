The elusive PS5 console is in stock at Best Buy. The retailer is offering both the disc-based and digital editions of the console, starting at $399. Opportunities to snag one of these next-gen consoles have been even fewer and farther between than in late 2020, possibly due to the global chip shortages. We're noticing that stock is coming in and out, so stick with the page for a few minutes to see if you can add one to your cart.
