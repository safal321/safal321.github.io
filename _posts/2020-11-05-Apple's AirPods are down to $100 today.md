At Amazon, you can get Apple's AirPods that include a wired charging case for $100, down from their usual $160 price. Costco members can get this same price, too, though it'll cost a little more if you aren't a member. If you fall into the latter group, you'll need to create an account, then check out with the non-member surcharge that tacks on a 5 percent fee to the total. In this case, it was a paltry $7 that brings the total (plus tax) up to around $115. Not bad at all.
