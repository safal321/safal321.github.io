Sony may be working on a version of its Back Button Attachment for the PlayStation 5's DualSense controller, according to a patent filing published earlier this month. The filing, spotted by IGN, shows off an accessory identical in appearance to the existing DualShock 4 Back Button Attachment, describing the product as an add-on with buttons that “may be mapped to controller buttons using customized button mapping pre-sets.”
