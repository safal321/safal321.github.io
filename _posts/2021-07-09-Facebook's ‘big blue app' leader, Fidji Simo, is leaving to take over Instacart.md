The online grocery startup Instacart just announced its new CEO will take over on August 2nd. Fidji Simo has been in charge of Facebook's “big blue app” since 2019, putting her in charge of “News Feed, Stories, Groups, Video, Marketplace, Gaming, News, Dating and Ads,” but now, like a number of former Facebook execs recently, she's headed to Instacart ahead of its expected IPO.
