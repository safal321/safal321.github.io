Pokxc3xa9mon Go creator Niantic has published a blog post detailing some of its anti-cheat efforts, and it seems the company has been busy. Since the start of 2020, Niantic has issued over 5 million “punishments” to players caught cheating, with over 20 percent of those being permabans. Doing the math, that's over a million people who have gotten the boot in just over a year. This includes bans from Pokxc3xa9mon Go, Ingress, and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.
