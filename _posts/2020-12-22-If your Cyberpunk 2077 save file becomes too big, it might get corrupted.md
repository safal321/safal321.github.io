I can barely go anywhere on the internet without seeing yet another wild, hilarious, or downright odd bug from Cyberpunk 2077. It's a buggy game, and developer CD Projekt Red has already released two hotfixes to try and shore up some of the problems. One issue that's starting to pop up, though, isn't funny at all: some players are reporting that their Cyberpunk 2077 save files are becoming corrupted if they exceed a certain file size (via Eurogamer).
