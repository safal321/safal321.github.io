Live-streaming is taking off, culturally speaking. More people than ever are familiar with the concept — whether that's from Instagram Live (which is currently having its own moment) or Twitch. Mixer, Microsoft's live-streaming service, has had a number of high-profile successes lately, signing streamers with huge audiences like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins and Cory “King Gothalion” Michael to exclusive agreements.
