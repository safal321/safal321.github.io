Samsung's Galaxy S20 lineup innovates on many fronts. For most consumers, the S20 will be the first 5G device they ever lay their hands on, the first phones with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 865 processor, and the debut of Samsung's much-hyped 108-megapixel sensor (at least on the S20 Ultra). But the most important feature the S20 lineup is going to introduce to most phone owners might be the one that isn't actually that new at all: the high-refresh 120Hz display.
