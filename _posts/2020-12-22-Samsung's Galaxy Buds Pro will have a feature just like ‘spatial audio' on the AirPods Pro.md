With its upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro, Samsung is planning to counter one of the differentiating features of Apple's AirPods Pro (and now AirPods Max): spatial audio. Spatial audio crams an immersive, surround sound-like experience into a set of earbuds or headphones. And it accurately keeps the sound source anchored to your iPhone or iPad, so if you turn your head, you'll notice that the audio stays in front of you. Wherever you move the device, that's where it'll sound like the audio track is coming from.
