CBS drama series All Rise will produce a “virtual” episode themed on the COVID-19 pandemic, shooting footage in the actors' homes and using VFX to create backgrounds. It's the first episode of a primetime scripted series to be produced while practicing social distancing by using remote programs like FaceTime, WebEx, and Zoom.
