Samsung's entire range of S20 series phones is available at all-time-low prices at a few retailers, including Amazon, B&H Photo, and eBay (sold by Microsoft). We covered discounts from eBay a few weeks ago, but today's prices are significantly better. Each phone below is unlocked, with support for GSM and CDMA carriers, so you can get service from T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon as well as MVNOs and global carriers. If you want to add 5G to your monthly bill, the S20 FE and the standard S20 offered below support sub-6GHz but not Verizon's UWB mmWave 5G. However, the S20 Plus and S20 Ultra support both types of 5G networks out of the box.
