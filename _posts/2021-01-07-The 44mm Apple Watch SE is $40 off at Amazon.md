Amazon is offering a good deal on the 44mm-sized Apple Watch SE (GPS). Normally $309, it's $270 for the model built with space gray aluminum that comes with a black sport band. For now, this puts both the 40mm and larger 44mm Apple Watch SE at the same price. If you're wondering where the SE sits among all of Apple's recent smartwatches in terms of specs, it has the same processor as the Apple Watch 5, but it notably lacks its ECG capability and the ability to have an always-on display. No other retailers are currently offering this deal.
