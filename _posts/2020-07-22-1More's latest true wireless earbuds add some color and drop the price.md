1More's ColorBuds True Wireless Headphones are a new pair of earbuds that focus on design and affordability over top-of-the-line specs. At just $99, they're half the price of 1More's recent pair of noise-canceling earbuds, the 1More True Wireless ANC, and they're also a lot lighter at just 4.1g per earbud compared to 7.9g with the previous model.
