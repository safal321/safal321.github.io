I've had a review unit of the new 27-inch iMac for about two days now â€” long enough to start poking at it and give you some impressions of what it's like. Most of the improvements on the iMac bring it up to the specs you'd expect in a 2020 computer: 10th Gen Intel processors, SSDs standard, and so on. My unit also has Apple's $500 nano texture finish on the glass, which Apple says is a big improvement over traditional matte displays. (For $500, it had better be.)
