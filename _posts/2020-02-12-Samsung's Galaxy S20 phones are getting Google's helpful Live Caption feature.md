Samsung's Galaxy S20 lineup will be the first non-Pixel phones to gain Google's Live Caption feature, which transcribes and captions videos in real time with excellent accuracy â€” even when the volume is turned down. Live Caption debuted on Android 10 with the Pixel 4, and Google positions it as a helpful tool among Android's accessibility features. It has since come to older Pixel devices, but Samsung is the first outside of Google to offer it.
