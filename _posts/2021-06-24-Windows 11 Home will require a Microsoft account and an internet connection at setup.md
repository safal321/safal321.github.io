Microsoft unveiled Windows 11 on Thursday, and its least expensive version Windows 11 Home will now require an internet connection at setup â€” and a Microsoft account. Previous versions would let you opt out of Microsoft accounts by creating a local account instead, though the company didn't necessarily make it easy to find and pushed you to use Microsoft's login instead. It's possible you'll still be able to use a local account afterwards.
