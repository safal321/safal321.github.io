The US National Hockey League announced on Thursday that it will “pause” its 2019xe2x80x9320 season amid growing concerns over the novel coronavirus pandemic. While there are no reports of an NHL player testing positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, the NBA suspended its season on Wednesday “until further notice,” after a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for the virus. As NHL commissioner Gary Bettman notes, several teams in the two leagues share facilities. The NHL suspension begins with tonight's games.
