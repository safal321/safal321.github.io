Razer's latest Blade 15 Advanced gaming laptop is $600 off its usual price at the Microsoft Store. Normally $2,600 (and still that price over at Razer's site), it's down to $2,000. That's still a lot of money, but this configuration makes up for it with solid specs. It features a 15.6-inch FHD display with a fast 300Hz refresh rate, so your games and other content will display smoothly, and the eight-core Intel Core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia RTX 2070 Super Max-Q graphics chip are a powerful duo. This model also features 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe SSD (both of which are user-upgradeable).
