Pokxc3xa9mon Sword and Shield for the Nintendo Switch have somehow resisted much in the way of a major price drop since they released in late 2019, but both games are $20 off their usual price at Amazon and Best Buy, down to $40 each for the physical cartridge versions. This is the lowest price yet, and if you were holding off until a deal arrived, or are planning to gift the game to someone over the holidays, now is the time to buy.
