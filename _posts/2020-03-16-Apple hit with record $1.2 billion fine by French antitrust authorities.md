France's competition authority, the Autoritxc3xa9 de la Concurrence, has fined Apple xe2x82xac1.1 billion (around $1.2 billion) for illegally restricting how wholesalers sell Apple products. As well as fining Apple itself, the authority has also fined two of its wholesalers, Tech Data, and Ingram Micro, Reuters reports. The Autoritxc3xa9 de la Concurrence launched its probe in 2012, when the premium reseller eBizcuss.com launched a complaint shortly before going out of business, Politico reported last week. The authority said the fine is the highest it's ever given.
