There are many things that don't make sense about global capitalism that I enjoy anyway â€” the clearly inadvisable, venture-backed monstrosities like dockless scooters and ride-sharing that, in the before times, changed how I interacted with the places I went. The thing that doesn't compute for me is how these companies continue to burn through a reality-warping amount of other people's cash in a way that upends the basic economics of things like taxi service and food delivery and fail, intentionally, to turn a profit.
