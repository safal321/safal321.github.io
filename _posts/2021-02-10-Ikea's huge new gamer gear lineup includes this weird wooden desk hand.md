In an ideal world, we'd always keep a hand free to protect our precious gaming gear. But for those times when you're busy, Ikea has released a xc2xa5129.00 (around $20) wooden hand to act as a caretaker — just one of dozens of new gaming products just launched in China. As Ikea explains it, the Lxc3xa5nespelare accessories stand (or the Gaming Hand, as we'll be calling it) “takes care of cables, headsets and other gadgets that you want tidied away, yet still have within reach.” Sounds, uh, handy?
