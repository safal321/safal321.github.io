Last year, Analogue announced the Pocket, a sleek and modern handheld designed to play all your old Game Boy cartridges. It was originally slated to launch this year, but due to the current state of the world, it's now expected to debut in May 2021. Analogue cites “the unfortunate global state of affairs and supply chain challenges outside of our control” as the reason for the delay. But there's good news. Analogue is starting pre-orders for the handheld very soon; they'll open up on August 3rd at 8AM PT / 11AM ET.
