There is a wide variety of products seeing decent price cuts today. Some are new, and others have been happening for a while. One deal that I'm particularly happy to see return is the $50 off deal on Beats' new Solo Pro wireless noise-canceling headphones. Normally $300, they're $250 at Amazon right now.
