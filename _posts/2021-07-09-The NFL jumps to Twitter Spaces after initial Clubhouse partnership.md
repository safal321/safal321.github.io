The National Football League is signing on to use Twitter Spaces. As part of a new deal with Twitter — which will see the social network continue to run game highlight videos — the NFL has agreed to host 20 live audio rooms throughout the 2021 season. Those will include “current NFL players and other NFL talent” as hosts discussing the season's matchups.
