eBay is hosting a President's Day sale specifically on refurbished products. One of the best offers we've spotted is for Bose's over-ear Noise Canceling 700 Headphones. These normally sell for $380, but you can get a certified refurbished pair for just $224 (before tax) by putting in the code PREZDAY20 at checkout. This is an exciting deal because each color is currently available, and Bose is the seller here, so it has handled the refurbishment process.
