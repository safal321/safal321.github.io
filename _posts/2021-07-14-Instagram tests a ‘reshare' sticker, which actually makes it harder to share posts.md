Instagram doesn't want you to spam your friends with all of the posts you come across and like. So today, it's starting a test to make sharing to Stories slightly trickier. The company is testing a “reshare” sticker that can be placed in Stories. When selected, a “recently viewed” tab will surface and let users choose from posts they've seen in the last hour, saved, or posted, which they can then share in their story. They can insert IGTV, reels, and feed video content.
