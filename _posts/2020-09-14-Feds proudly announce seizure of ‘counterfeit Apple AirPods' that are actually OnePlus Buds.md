In a truly bizarre situation that I'm still trying to wrap my head around, US Customs and Border Protection tonight tweeted that its officers had “recently seized 2,000 counterfeit Apple AirPods from Hong Kong, valued at $398K had they been genuine.” There's also a press release: “CBP officers are protecting the American public from various dangers on a daily basis,” said Troy Miller, director of CBP's New York field operations, in the release. “The interception of these counterfeit earbuds is a direct reflection of the vigilance and commitment to mission success by our CBP Officers daily.” These units originated from Hong Kong and were seized at JFK on August 31st; they were headed to Nevada, according to the press release.
