Even the authorities think that too many earbuds look like AirPods nowadays, including those from well-known companies. US Customs and Border Protection tonight tweeted that its officers had “recently seized 2,000 counterfeit Apple AirPods from Hong Kong, valued at $398K had they been genuine.” There's also this press release: “CBP officers are protecting the American public from various dangers on a daily basis,” Troy Miller, director of CBP's New York field operations, said in the release. “The interception of these counterfeit earbuds is a direct reflection of the vigilance and commitment to mission success by our CBP Officers daily.”
