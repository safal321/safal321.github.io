The original OnePlus Nord skipped North America, but OnePlus is finally bringing two cheaper, mid-range options from its Nord line to the US and Canada on January 15th. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers flagship standards like a high-refresh rate 90Hz display and fast charging for $299.99 ($389 CAD), while the OnePlus Nord N100 features an even larger display and battery for $179.99 ($239 CAD). After launching in Europe last year, both phones are now carrier-exclusives for T-Mobile and available unlocked from OnePlus and other online retailers in the US.
