Google's Stadia game streaming service is officially adding support for messaging, the service has announced. Messages can be sent to members of your party (who you could previously voice chat with) as well as other players more generally. Alongside it, the service has also announced support for sharing screenshots and video clips on the web via sending links, and it's adding more information to Stadia profiles. Although these are all fairly basic features, they're a standard part of most online gaming services, and it's good to see Stadia finally implement them.
