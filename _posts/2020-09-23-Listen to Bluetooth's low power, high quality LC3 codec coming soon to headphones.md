Bluetooth SIG, the industry group in charge of defining the standard, has released a new audio codec that promises to make wireless headphones more power-efficient while improving sound quality. The Low Complexity Communication Codec, or LC3 for short, can transmit at much lower bitrates without as big a drop in audio quality as you see with Bluetooth's standard, and much maligned, SBC codec. The development of the new codec was first announced back at CES 2020.
