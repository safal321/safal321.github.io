You can't claim to be a flagship phone in 2020 without having a high-refresh-rate display, and a new benchmark has now been set. RedMagic, a sub-brand of ZTE sub-brand Nubia, is putting its latest gaming phone up for global pre-order today, making the RedMagic 5G the first phone you'll be able to buy with a 144Hz screen. That's the standard refresh rate for high-end PC gaming monitors.
