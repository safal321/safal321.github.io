Samsung's entire rumored device lineup for today's upcoming Unpacked event has been spoiled by a series of videos from leaker Evan Blass. Most interesting is the hands-on footage of Samsung's unannounced Galaxy Z Fold 2 foldable (most previous leaks have only been press renders), but the videos also include footage of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, the Galaxy Tab S7 tablet, the Galaxy Buds true wireless earbuds, and the Galaxy Watch 3 smartwatch.
