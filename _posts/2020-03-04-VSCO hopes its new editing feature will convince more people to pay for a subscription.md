VSCO, the social media network and photo / video editing app, is rolling out a new feature globally today that it thinks will set it apart from all the other photo and video sharing apps. Called Montage, the feature allows paying members to edit photo and video together on one canvas, creating a collage effect. They can choose to make their creation in a portrait, landscape, or square aspect ratio and can select from photos or videos in their camera roll to add to their scene. They can then expand that scene into multiple moments, up to two minutes long, so the entire collage changes. The creations save as a .mov file if they involve multiple scenes and moving images, but if they're just a single scene with stills, it'll save as a .jpg.
