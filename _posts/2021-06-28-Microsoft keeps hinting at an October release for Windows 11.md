Microsoft keeps hinting at an October release date for Windows 11. The software giant teased an October date several times during its Windows event last week, including one instance where a Microsoft Teams message says “excited to turn it up to 11... can't wait for October!” Microsoft has only officially said “holiday” for Windows 11 availability, but the company's official marketing material strongly hints at an October 20th date.
