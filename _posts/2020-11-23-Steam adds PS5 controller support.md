Valve has officially announced that the PS5's DualSense controller is now supported in Steam. Games using the Steam Input API can now recognize the controller and display the correct button prompts. They'll also be able to access the DualSense's LED, trackpad, rumble, and gyro features, though there's no mention of support for its adaptive triggers. The functionality is currently available in Steam's public beta client, with plans for a full release “after further testing.”
