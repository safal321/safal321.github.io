Subreddit r/WallStreetBets has been the talk of the Internet this week, as its members have driven GameStop's stock prices from around $20 to over $300. The community brands itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” and as time has gone on, it's targeted other unlikely stocks like AMC, Blackberry, and Tootsie Roll.
