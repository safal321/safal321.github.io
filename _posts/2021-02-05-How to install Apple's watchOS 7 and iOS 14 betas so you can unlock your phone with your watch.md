Apple's iOS 14.5 beta is out, and with it comes the ability to have your Apple Watch unlock your Face ID-protected phone if you happen to be wearing a mask. If you really want this feature right now, you'll have to download the latest iOS and watchOS betas â€” something that does come with at least a little risk, as it's unfinished software. There are bugs, and features might change between updates. There have been reports in the past of watches being bricked by betas (though I didn't find any for this release).
