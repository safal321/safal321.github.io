As we stumble into the second month of quarantine in many US cities, it's clear that by and large, we're starting to adapt. Things that felt strange, perhaps antisocial and even reactionary — like grocery stores only allowing a limited number of people in at a time — are newly normal. It's easier to claim personal space even in cities now that most people have accepted social distancing as the norm. That six-foot rule, however, is sometimes hard to follow, especially in population-dense places where the expectation is that people will share public space. In New York City, for example, it's remarkably difficult: the mayor hasn't closed many streets, and the sidewalks — plentiful though they are — feel really small.
