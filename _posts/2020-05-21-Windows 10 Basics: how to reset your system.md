Windows 10 is, on the whole, more trouble-free than its previous iterations — but sometimes, things just go wrong. A couple of years ago, I made the mistake of not checking to make sure my laptop was securely plugged in while Windows was undergoing a major update. The battery ran out in the middle of the update and voila! I was stuck with what I was sure was now a very expensive brick. I was reminded of this just the other day, when another Windows 10 system decided that it didn't like the latest update and began misbehaving very badly — so badly, that it would stop reacting to the cursor one minute after it booted.
