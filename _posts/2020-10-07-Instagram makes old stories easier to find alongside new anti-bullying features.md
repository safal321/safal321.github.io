Instagram is adding new features to help users find old stories posted over the last three years and to reduce abusive behavior. The stories archive now includes a new monthly calendar view, which shows the days you posted each story, alongside a map which shows story locations, TechCrunch reports. Instagram also announced a pair of new anti-bullying features which attempt to automatically hide potentially abusive comments while discouraging users from posting them in the first place.
