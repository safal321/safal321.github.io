Amazon is reopening its six distribution centers in France beginning today, according to a reporter from CNN. The company shut down the warehouses in April due to a labor dispute with workers who alleged that the internet retailer wasn't doing enough to protect them from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The six warehouses are set to “gradually reopen” starting today, according to an Amazon spokesperson speaking to CNN.
