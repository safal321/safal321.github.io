I'm always on the lookout for off-the-beaten-path Twitch streams, and today, a pal recommended a great one: a mechanic who streams himself fixing cars on Twitch. (The audio is surprisingly clear, too.) I watched for a while today as he replaced the transmission on a Kia, which had its previous transmission destroyed after something put a hole in it on the highway. It's the kind of thing I'm always trying to find on Twitch: a keyhole look at someone else's life. I love watching people doing things I'll never be able to do.
