Verizon's 4G LTE-based home broadband service targeting rural communities is now available in 48 states, and it might be worth a look if it's available in your area. The service, called “LTE Home Internet,” offers unlimited data, no data usage caps, and typical download speeds of 25Mbps with peak speeds of 50Mbps. But it's only available in “parts” of 189 markets, and only in areas where the company doesn't already offer other broadband options such as Fios or its in-home 5G service.
