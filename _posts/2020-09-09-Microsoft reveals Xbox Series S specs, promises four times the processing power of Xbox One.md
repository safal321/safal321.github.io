Microsoft is fully detailing its new Xbox Series S console today. The $299 next-gen console will arrive on November 10th, designed to be a more affordable option for 1440p gaming. Microsoft is using the same CPU from the Xbox Series X inside the Series S, running at 3.6Hz. “The primary difference between Xbox Series X and S is the GPU,” explains Jason Ronald, Microsoft's director of Xbox program management.
