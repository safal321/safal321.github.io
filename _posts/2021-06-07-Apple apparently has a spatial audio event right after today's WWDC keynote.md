Apple appears to have planned a dedicated event on Apple Music's upcoming spatial audio feature for later today. According to a video that MacRumors says was uploaded to Apple Music as a teaser — it's since been removed — Apple will broadcast a special event called “Introducing Spatial Audio.” The event doesn't appear on the Worldwide Developers Conference schedule but is set for 3PM ET.
