Microsoft's smallest Surface tablet is getting some important hardware upgrades today in the form of the Surface Go 2. The most significant change is a bigger display: now 10.5 inches, up from the 10-inch panel on the original. That doesn't alter the overall size of the Surface Go 2, but it does reduce the bezels slightly. They're not as skinny as the ones found on the Surface Pro X, but they're certainly nowhere near as big as the original Surface Go from nearly two years ago.
