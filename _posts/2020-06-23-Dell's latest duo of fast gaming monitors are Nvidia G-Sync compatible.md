Dell has announced a new 27-inch curved gaming monitor called the S2721HGF, which, at $279.99, is more affordable than the company's other curved options. It supports 1080p resolution and has Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, so those who use a recent Nvidia GPU should be run games smoothly with no screen tearing. This new monitor has a 1500R curved VA panel in a 16:9 aspect ratio with a 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. So it's right up there in terms of capabilities with most other gaming monitors, and for the price, it seems stacked with value.
