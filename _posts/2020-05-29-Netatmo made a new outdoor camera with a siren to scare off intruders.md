Netatmo has released an updated version of its outdoor security smart camera with a powerful alarm to scare off uninvited guests. The revised security camera remains mostly unchanged from Netatmo's previous outdoor model. However, this version includes a built-in 105dB siren, meant to scare off any intruders. The siren can be manually activated by using the Netatmo app after you receive an alert that a person or vehicle has entered your property.
