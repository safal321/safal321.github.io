The Haunting of Bly Manor, which premiered last week on Netflix, makes me a little sad I've never seen a ghost. It's the second series from The Haunting of Hill House creator Mike Flanagan. Like American Horror Story, the Haunting shows are anthology dramas, with each series telling a self-contained story. They're not connected, in other words, other than by cast and aesthetic â€” each show is a drama first, horror show second, set largely in lush, spooky estates.
