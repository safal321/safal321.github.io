John Legere has formally cut ties with T-Mobile US, the company he led as CEO for over seven years. After steering T-Mobile through a dramatic turnaround that culminated in its successful merger with former rival Sprint, Legere stepped down and Mike Sievert was appointed T-Mobile's new chief executive earlier this month. At that time, Legere had said he would remain on T-Mobile's board of directors until June 4th.<br/><br/>But that's not the case anymore. In an 8K filing with the SEC today, T-Mobile revealed that Legere is leaving the board “effective immediately to pursue other options.”<br/><br/>“Mr. Legere noted that he was not resigning because of any disagreement with management or the board on any matter,” T-Mobile said in its note, which also contained a quote from Legere addressed to the company and its employees:<br/><br/>In his notice to the company, Mr. Legere stated “It has been a privilege and honor to have led T-Mobile as CEO for the past seven and a half years and served on the Board of Directors. And although I will be leaving the Board just a few weeks earlier than planned, be assured that I remain T-Mobile's #1 fan!”<br/><br/>Whatever Legere has planned next, apparently it couldn't wait another month and change. During his time as T-Mobile CEO, Legere stood out from other executives for his outspoken personality and brazen, often vulgar trash talk directed at competitors like Verizon and AT&T. He branded T-Mobile as the “uncarrier” and led the company through a transformation that involved moving away from two-year contracts, subsidized phone pricing, and other business practices that had become status quo for the mobile industry. Many of those changes were later adopted by T-Mobile's rivals.<br/><br/>Legere has offered few clues about where he's headed, though he did refute reports in November that he'd been in discussions to join WeWork. Since stepping down as T-Mobile CEO, Legere has continued engaging with his large social media following — he's got over 6.5 million Twitter followers — via Periscope and other platforms.<br/><br/>Earlier on Friday, Legere offered kind sentiments to outgoing AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson after the company announced that he'll be succeeded by John Stankey in July. It's definitely something of a new era for leadership at the big wireless providers.<br/><br/>Truly an end of an era at @ATT. Thanks for all the years of competition, Randall. Enjoy the time off! I recommend growing a beard  https://t.co/VG1oyfVOAI<br/><br/>Let the speculation about Legere's next destination begin.<br/><br/>
