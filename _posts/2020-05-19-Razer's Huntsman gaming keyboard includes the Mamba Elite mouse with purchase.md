Over the weekend, Best Buy began offering a big discount on the Razer Huntsman full-sized wired mechanical gaming keyboard and the Razer Mamba Elite wired gaming mouse. Instead of paying $120 for the keyboard alone, you'll get the mouse (usually $90 on its own) included for free with your purchase. When you add the keyboard to your cart, the mouse will follow automatically. This deal will last through this Saturday, May 23rd.
