Leica is no stranger to releasing cameras that buck the norm, such as its M10-D which lacks an LCD screen entirely or the various generations of M Monochrom cameras that only capture black-and-white images. The company is now expanding that Monochrom line with the new Q2 Monochrom, available starting on November 10th for $5,995.
