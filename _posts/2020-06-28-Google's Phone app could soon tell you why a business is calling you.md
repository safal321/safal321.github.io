Google is piloting a new Verified Calls feature for its Phone app in Brazil that shows call recipients a business' name, logo, and the reason for its call. News of the feature first appeared on a Google support page that was spotted by Android Police, and Google subsequently confirmed the pilot to The Verge. The feature relies on a business supplying its phone number, your phone number, and the reason for its call directly to Google, which pushes this information to the Phone app. If the information lines up, then the phone app gives the call a Verified Call badge.
