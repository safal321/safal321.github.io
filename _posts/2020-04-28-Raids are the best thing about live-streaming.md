Live-streaming isn't a wilderness, but it can feel that way sometimes: even if you know what you're doing, finding your way to someone new can be daunting. That's why my favorite thing about live-streaming is the raid, which is when a streamer who's done streaming sends their entire live audience to another currently live streamer. (Yes, it's opt in.) As a viewer, it feels like taking part in an event â€” suddenly, you, in your numbers, are a piece of entertainment. And as a bonus, now you have something new to watch after your streamer has signed off.
