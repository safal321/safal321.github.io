Amsterdam, a city where bikes outnumber inhabitants and roughly half of all commutes happen on two wheels, might seem like an odd choice of location to launch a new car brand, but Lynk & Co isn't your typical car company. Created by Geely and Volvo, Lynk & Co is trying to do things differently. First, by focusing on vehicle sharing instead of individual ownership, and second, by attracting potential customers through its own social “clubs.” The first club is now open in a historic building in central Amsterdam, six months before Lynk & Co's first connected car — the 01 compact SUV hybrid or plug-in hybrid — begins shipping throughout Europe.
