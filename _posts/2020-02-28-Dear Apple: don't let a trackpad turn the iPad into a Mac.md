Good morning and congratulations on making it through another week. I had been planning on writing about some of the issues I had while writing my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra review â€” specifically my bafflement that Samsung is once again asking reviewers like me to be beta testers. It's inconceivable that the company didn't realize there were issues with the camera and also very strange that it didn't so much as hint at a software update to me until the day before yesterday. I'll say it again: never buy anything on the hope that future software updates will fix it. Wait.
