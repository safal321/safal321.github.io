Microsoft is adding support for smaller gatherings to its Together Mode feature of Teams, which uses AI to place all of the participants in a meeting into virtual environments (via OnMSFT). Sports fans may recognize the feature from the NBA's use of it during the pandemic to provide a crowd-like experience for basketball games. The change to allow smaller crowds is somewhat the opposite of that and is currently in beta. Given Microsoft's focus on Teams as a personal communications app as well as a corporate one, it's not necessarily surprising that Together Mode will be able to work for family gatherings as well as company-wide all-hands.
