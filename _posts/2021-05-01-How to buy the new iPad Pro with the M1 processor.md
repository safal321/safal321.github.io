Apple announced a 2021 refresh to its iPad Pro lineup, which now includes the same powerful and efficient M1 processor that's in its MacBook Air, Pro, and Mac mini computers. Both the new 11-inch and 12.9-inch models will feature the chip, as well as a Thunderbolt port and optional 5G support. The display on the larger tablet has received a particularly big boost, jumping to a Liquid Retina XDR Mini LED screen. My colleague Monica Chin has gone deeper on more of this year's big improvements.
