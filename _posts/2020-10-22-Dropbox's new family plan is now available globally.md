Dropbox's new family plan, Dropbox Family, is now available globally. With Dropbox Family, up to six people can have their own accounts with all of the features in a Dropbox Plus plan, a combined 2 TB of storage, and a dedicated space to share files across accounts (called, fittingly, the Family Room). Up until today, Dropbox Family was only available in beta to select users, Dropbox tells The Verge.
