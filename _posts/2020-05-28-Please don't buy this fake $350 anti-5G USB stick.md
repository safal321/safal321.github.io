Scammers are trying to sell a $350 USB key with just 128MB of storage as an anti-5G solution. The “5GBioShield” went on sale recently in the UK priced between xc2xa3280 and xc2xa3330 ($343 and $405), and promises to use “quantum holographic catalyzer technology” to protect a family home against 5G. Unsurprisingly, the USB key is fake, and it's actually a regular $6 USB stick that only has 128MB of storage. That hasn't stopped conspiracy theorists from promoting it, however.
