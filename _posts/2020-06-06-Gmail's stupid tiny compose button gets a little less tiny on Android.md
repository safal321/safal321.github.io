Google has tweaked the appearance of the compose button in Gmail's Android app. First spotted by 9to5Google, the old button, a small “floating action button” with a plus in it, is now an oblong button containing a pen icon along with the word “Compose.” It minimizes into its old circle shape when you scroll down your list of emails. Ultimately, though, I'd still argue that the bottom-right of the screen is a bad place for the app's most important button.
