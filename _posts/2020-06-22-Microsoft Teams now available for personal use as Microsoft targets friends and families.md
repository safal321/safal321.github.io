Microsoft is launching the personal version of Microsoft Teams today in preview. It's part of a broader effort by Microsoft to remain relevant with consumers and win them back after a series of exits from consumer-friendly services. Microsoft isn't rebranding Teams here or offering a totally separate version, nor is the company looking to compete with iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or other dedicated chat apps. It's simply repositioning the existing Microsoft Teams app with features that might appeal to a set of people looking to do more than just chat.
