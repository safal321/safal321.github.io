I really like the idea of Stadia. Google's cloud gaming service was unveiled just a year ago with the promise that the future of gaming isn't a box under your TV but a place instead. Stadiums have hosted sports for centuries, and Google sold Stadia as a new venue to build a virtual stadium for the future of games that stream to any device you own. It's supposed to be full of people discovering games from YouTube links or playing along with creators and streamers. Instead, it feels like Google is still in the process of building its stadium, and it's empty.
