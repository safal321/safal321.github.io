Samsung is updating its Galaxy A51 and A71 handsets with a collection of new features from its flagship Galaxy S20 series. These include new camera functionality like Single Take and Night Hyperlapse, along with new sharing, search, and translation features. Samsung's announcement doesn't say exactly when the update is releasing, but GSMArena previously reported that the functionality had started rolling out to the A51 last month.
