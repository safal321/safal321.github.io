Nike, Sony, and basketball player Paul George have collaborated on another pair of sneakers, the PG 5, with help from PS5 designer Yujin Morisawa. According to Sony, “the colors of the shoe are heavily inspired by the industrial design of the PS5” with the PlayStation's signature circle, square, cross, and triangle shapes woven into the materials like a DualSense controller. There's also a PlayStation logo on the tongue of the right shoe, while the left's tongue has Paul George's PG logo.
