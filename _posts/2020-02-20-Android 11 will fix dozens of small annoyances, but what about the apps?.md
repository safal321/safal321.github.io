Yesterday, Google released a developer preview of the next version of Android, which is called “Android 11” instead of “Android R” for simplicity (and because Google hates desserts now, that's canon). It's earlier than Google has ever released a version of Android, and as I noted in my story on the release I think that's because there are a lot of changes that Android developers will have to contend with.
