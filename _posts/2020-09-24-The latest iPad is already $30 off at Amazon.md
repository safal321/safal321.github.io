Apple's eighth-generation iPad is $299 at Amazon, which is $30 less than its retail price. Needless to say, it's a good deal if you were in the market for one of these. If you want 128GB of storage instead of 32GB that comes by default, you'll need to pay more â€” but that pricier model is also less than it usually costs. It's $395 instead of $429. Best of all, Amazon has all colors available at a discount (silver, space gray, and gold), though the waiting times for delivery vary depending on which one you want. At the time of publishing, the longest-possible wait is four weeks.
