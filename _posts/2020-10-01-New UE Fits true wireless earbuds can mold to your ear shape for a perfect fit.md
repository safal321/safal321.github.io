Most of us stick with the silicone ear tips that come in the box with our earbuds; usually one of the small / medium / large sizes makes for a good enough seal to enhance bass and increase noise isolation. Stepping up from that, you get foam tips like those from Comply that expand to fill your ear canal for top-notch sound. But the pinnacle of earbud listening comes when you have a completely custom, personalized ear tip that's perfectly fitted to the contours of your ear.
