As Lil Nas X moves through the setlist of his next concert, the world will change around him. It'll transform from an Old West set, complete with wooden saloons and spinning dust devils as he sings “Old Town Road,” into a darker, almost vampiric stage for “Rodeo.” Later, it will morph again into a futuristic city as he plays “Panini.” This sort of larger-than-life, impossibly elaborate staging is one of the advantages of performing inside of Roblox — the hit kids game — where Lil Nas X will become the first major artist to use the platform for a fully virtual concert this week.
