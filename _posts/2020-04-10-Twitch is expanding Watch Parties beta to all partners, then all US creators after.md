Twitch announced today that it's bringing its beta version of Watch Parties, which allows streamers to broadcast Prime Video content, to all of its partners â€” and then all American creators. That means every streamer in the US on Twitch will be able to watch Prime content with their viewers, regardless of whether they're a Twitch Partner. The company plans to bring Watch Parties worldwide eventually, with more news coming in the next few months.
