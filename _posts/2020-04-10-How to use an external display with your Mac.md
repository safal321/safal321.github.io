Every computer I've called my own for work or personal use has been a laptop. I love the portability of a laptop. It's great to do work while lounging in my favorite chair or at a coffee shop (when we could still do that). But it's really hard for me to put in a full workday hunched over one. To fix that, I've found that plugging my laptop to an external monitor on my desk is essential for me to be productive. Now I can't imagine working without one.
