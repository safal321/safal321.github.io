The League of Legends World Championship kicks off this week, and teams want to look their best â€” so Korean side Gen.G partnered with famed streetwear designer Heron Preston for their new Worlds jersey. The all-black Puma kit was unveiled today, and it's a relatively simple design, with Gen.G's logo displayed prominently on the front and a retro-inspired globe on the back. Preston's involvement is also hard to miss; his name is in big blue letters just above the team's logo.
