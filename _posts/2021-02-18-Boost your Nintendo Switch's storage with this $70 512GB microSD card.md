It's a good thing that Nintendo's Switch supports microSD because prices for the expandable storage format just keep getting better. Today, for instance, you can buy PNY's 512GB microSD card at Amazon for just $70. It's a Deal of the Day, so this price will expire later tonight. Previously, it was rare to find this amount of storage for less than $100, and with each Switch game being between 5-15GB in size, this will serve you a long time.
