Huawei is rereleasing its flagship phone from last year as the P30 Pro “New Edition.” The device now ships with Android 10 preinstalled, and it's got a new silver color option that was previously only available on the P40 Pro. Otherwise, this is an identical device to last year's phone, meaning it has a 6.47-inch OLED display, four rear cameras, and, crucially, comes with a full suite of Google's apps and services.
