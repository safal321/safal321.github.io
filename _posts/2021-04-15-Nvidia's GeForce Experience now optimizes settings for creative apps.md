Nvidia has released a new feature for its GeForce Experience software that helps users of creative applications make sure they're getting the best performance out of their GPUs. GeForce Experience can now tell you whether you have the best settings enabled for more than 30 creative apps including DaVinci Resolve, Adobe's Lightroom and Illustrator, and Autodesk's AutoCAD. If certain GPU features aren't active, you can turn them on from within GeForce Experience itself “with a single button press.”
