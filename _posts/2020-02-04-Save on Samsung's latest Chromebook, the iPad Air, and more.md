The 15.6-inch version of Samsung's Chromebook 4 is down to its lowest price on Amazon. Normally $349.99, it's $279.99 right now. This model was introduced in late 2019, and it served as a successor to the woefully outdated Chromebook 3. It's a great value as far as Chromebooks are concerned. You'll be getting a laptop with a sizable 1080p display, a modern design, USB-C charging, and 6GB of RAM.
