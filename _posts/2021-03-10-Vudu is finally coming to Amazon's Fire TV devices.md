Vudu, the digital video service that was owned by Walmart before Fandango bought it last year, is finally making its way to the Amazon Fire TV platform. The app is a big source of high-quality, 4K HDR movie rentals. You can also access your existing Vudu library — including Movies Anywhere titles — with the Fire TV app, which should be rolling out in the coming days.
