Pidgeon Pagonis, an intersex activist, noticed last week that the #intersex hashtag wasn't working on TikTok. They couldn't click the tag on one of their own posts and trying to search for intersex pulled up a “null” page. This was the second time Pagonis noticed the tag disappearing, and they worried that TikTok had banned it just as they were about to start a series of celebratory videos called Intersex Joy.
