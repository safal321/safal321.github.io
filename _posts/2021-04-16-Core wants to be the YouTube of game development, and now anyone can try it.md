Core, the platform that hopes to help creators build games and players experience them, is launching for free in early access today. It's available exclusively on the Epic Games Store and already includes over 20,000 free playable games across a wide variety of genres including team-based multiplayer shooters, RPGs, and side-scrollers. Core's developer, Manticore Games, says that over a million players and creators have used the platform while it's been in alpha over the past year.
