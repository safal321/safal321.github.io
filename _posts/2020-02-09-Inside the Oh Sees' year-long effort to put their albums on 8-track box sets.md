The Oh Sees' latest release is a 12-album box set in an unexpected format: 8-track tapes. It's the culmination of a year-long effort by Seattle-based DIY label 5Seven Records, which restored vintage 8-track tapes and transformed them into albums from musician John Dwyer's bands, variously known as Oh Sees, Thee Oh Sees, and OCS.
