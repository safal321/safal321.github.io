A free Wi-Fi service at rail stations in the UK exposed the personal information of about 10,000 people, and the provider did not notify authorities because it considered the situation “low-risk,” the BBC reports. Email addresses, dates of birth and travel information were among the details visible in an unprotected database from provider C3UK, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler. Affected stations included Harlow Mill, Chelmsford, Colchester, Waltham Cross, Burnham, Norwich, and London Bridge, according to the BBC.
