Roku's new Voice Remote Pro is the company's first remote control to come with always-listening mics built in. These let you easily launch a streaming app or find the remote itself, should it get lost in the couch cushions, using just your voice. The new $29.99 remote, a standalone purchase that works with Roku streamers and Roku TVs, also has a headphone jack for private listening and includes buttons for controlling your TV's power and volume. And to round it all out, Roku throws in two customizable shortcut buttons that you can program to remember any voice command and repeat it with a press. Perhaps best of all, you won't need to hunt for AA batteries anymore: the Voice Remote Pro replaces them with a rechargeable battery that can last for up to two months on a charge.
