Taiwan is planning to lock out video streaming services from Chinese tech giants Baidu and Tencent. While such services are ostensibly already illegal in the self-governing island republic, Baidu's iQiyi and Tencent's WeTV currently operate under a legal loophole that allowed them to partner with local companies.
