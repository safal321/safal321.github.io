People are doing a lot more video conferencing now that they're stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions can be a great way to stay in touch with friends and family, conduct business with colleagues, and keep up with schoolwork. Sometimes, though, you may want to save a recording of the meeting so you can revisit it later. That could let you listen to a teacher's lecture again, use the audio for a podcast, or even relive the announcement of a family pregnancy (which is something that actually happened to me on a recent family video call).
