Publisher 505 Games is discounting most of its titles on Steam in time for Labor Day until September 8th. Topping the list includes Death Stranding, which hasn't seen many discounts. It's $45 instead of $60 and includes the soundtrack for free with purchase. Control Ultimate Edition has been $32 instead of $40 since it launched last week, but today's announcement means it's going to stay that price for a little while longer.
