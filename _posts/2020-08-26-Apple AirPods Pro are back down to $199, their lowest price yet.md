Newegg is hosting a great deal on Apple's AirPods Pro wireless earbuds. They're down to $199, which matches the best price that we've seen once before in early August. This model usually costs $250, and compared to the less expensive second-generation AirPods, these have better sound quality and noise cancellation.
