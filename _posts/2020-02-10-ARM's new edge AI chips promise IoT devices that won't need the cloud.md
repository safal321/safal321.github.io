Edge AI is one of the biggest trends in chip technology. These are chips that run AI processing on the edge â€” or, in other words, on a device without a cloud connection. Apple recently bought a company that specializes in it, Google's Coral initiative is meant to make it easier, and chipmaker ARM has already been working on it for years. Now, ARM is expanding its efforts in the field with two new chip designs: the Arm Cortex-M55 and the Ethos-U55, a neural processing unit meant to pair with the Cortex-M55 for more demanding use cases.
