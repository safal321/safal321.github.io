If you're always on the hunt for OLED TV discounts, Best Buy has a very good one today on Vizio's 55-inch model. So good, in fact, that three Verge staffers shouted expletives when they first saw it. Normally $1,300, it's $900 when you're signed in with your My Best Buy account. TVs of this caliber rarely, if ever, fall below the $1K mark, so it's worth thinking about whether you want to make the upgrade today. Best Buy hasn't shared how long this deal will last.
