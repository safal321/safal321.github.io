Whenever I've tried using Discord's mobile app to call a friend, I've found the audio quality to be pretty subpar. Sure, Discord's desktop app gives you a few options, like simply using a better mic, and there are a few ways to add noise suppression â€” particularly if you have an Nvidia graphics card. But now, Discord has added the same background noise suppression feature to its mobile app that it rolled out on desktop in April, meaning your phone's built-in mic or your earbuds should be able to take advantage as well.
