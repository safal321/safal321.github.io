In August 2020, mega-publisher Epic Games decided to stop paying what's dubbed the “Apple tax”: a 30 percent fee on digital purchases made through the iOS App Store. The company added a new feature to its blockbuster game Fortnite, letting users bypass the App Store's payment system to purchase V-Bucks, Fortnite's in-game currency. The move violated Apple's guidelines, and Apple promptly kicked Fortnite off the App Store. Epic sued Apple for antitrust violations, and on Monday, the case will finally go to court.
