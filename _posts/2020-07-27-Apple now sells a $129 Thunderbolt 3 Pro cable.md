Apple has released a new high-end Thunderbolt 3 cable in its online store. The $129 Thunderbolt 3 Pro cable is 2 meters long, has a black braided design, and supports both DisplayPort output and USB 3.1 Gen 2 10Gbps data transfer â€” though of course data speeds can be up to Thunderbolt 3's standard 40Gbps between compatible devices.
