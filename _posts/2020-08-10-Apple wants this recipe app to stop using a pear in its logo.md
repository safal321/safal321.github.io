Apple has filed a notice of opposition against a meal prep company because it claims the Prepear app's cartoon fruit logo— in this case, a pear— is too close to Apple's own trademarked logo which is, of course, an apple (via MacRumors and iPhone in Canada). The company claims the pear logo would “cause dilution of the distinctiveness” of the Apple logo, and make it difficult for consumers to distinguish between Prepear and Apple's goods and services, which it argues is a violation of the Lanham Act.
