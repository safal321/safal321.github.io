Amazon is announcing that it's adding Alexa to its Ring Video Doorbell Pro, giving it the ability to talk to people when they come to your house. The feature is called Alexa Greetings, and requires that you have a Ring Protect subscription, which starts at $3 a month. If you do, Alexa can ask your visitors what they want, and they can choose to leave a video recording as a message. If they're a delivery person, Alexa will be able to tell them where to leave the packages â€” assuming the delivery person is willing to talk to your robotic doorbell.
