Asus has taken the wraps off its new ZenBook S, a slim ultrabook that can be equipped with up to Intel's Core i7-1065G7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of fast PCIe-based storage.  Asus gave its flagship laptop a glow-up in the screen department, going from a 16:9 aspect ratio in last year's model to a taller 3:2 aspect ratio for this year's 3300 x 2200 touchscreen. What's more, the bezels surrounding it are thin, and the display is Pantone-validated with 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut.
