Amazon Prime Day 2020 is back for another day full of tech deals, and it will conclude later tonight at 12:00AM PT / 3:00AM ET. So, if you have a Prime membership, your time to take advantage of some of the biggest price drops is running out. The sale kicked off yesterday, and we saw hefty price cuts on must-have products, like Sony's WH-1000XM4 wireless noise-canceling headphones, AirPods wireless earbuds, tablets, and more. You can look forward to some of these deals to return, plus some news ones.
