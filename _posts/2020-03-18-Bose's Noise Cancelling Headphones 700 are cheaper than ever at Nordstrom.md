Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are $100 off right now at Nordstrom, a store usually known for deals on clothing, not gadgets. This model usually sells for $400, but Wirecutter Deals pointed out that you can snag them for $300 in black or silver. The 700s have seen a minor price drop here and there but nothing more than $50 since they released in mid-2019.
