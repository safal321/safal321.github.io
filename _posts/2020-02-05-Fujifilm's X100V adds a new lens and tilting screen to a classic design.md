Fujifilm today announced the fifth entry in its X100 series, the X100V, updating the company's take-everywhere camera with a new lens, a new sensor, a tilting rear LCD, and more. The X100V now shares the same 26.1-megapixel X-Trans IV CMOS APS-C sensor as the X-T3, X-T30, and X-Pro3. And it includes the new film simulations and other software tricks (including in-camera HDR and clarity adjustment) that debuted on the X-Pro3. The X100V ships later this month in black or silver for $1,399.99. That's $100 more than what its predecessor, the X100F, sold for at launch.
