Gadget maker Wyze, best known for its series of low-cost security cameras, is expanding further beyond its core product line to include new devices in the audio and smart home markets. The company is announcing three new products today: a pair of over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones, a video doorbell, and a smart thermostat. Those join the company's cameras, fitness band, and smart versions of various household appliances like a lock, lightbulb, and wall plug.
