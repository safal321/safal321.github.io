When Warner Bros. announced in mid-November that Wonder Woman 1984 will be available on HBO Max the same day it premieres in select theaters, I groaned. Not because of the decision to bring the movie right to the living room — that's the right call — but I knew that, at the time, all content on HBO Max still topped out at 1080p. Resolution is one area where the service badly trails its competitors. But it turns out, Wonder Woman 1984 will be the first title that starts to rectify that when it's released on December 25th.
