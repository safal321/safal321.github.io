Asus is taking a slightly different turn with this year's ZenFone series. While the ZenFone 8 Flip looks a lot like previous years' phones, with its large screen and flip-out camera mechanism, the company went back to the drawing board for the flagship ZenFone 8 and redesigned it as a smaller one-hand-friendly device: kind of an Android iPhone mini. The two phones make their global debut today, priced at xe2x82xac599 for the ZenFone 8 and xe2x82xac799 for the ZenFone 8 Flip. Asus says that only the ZenFone 8 will come to North America; it is expected this summer. The US price is still being finalized, but the company says it will cost somewhere between $599 and $799.
