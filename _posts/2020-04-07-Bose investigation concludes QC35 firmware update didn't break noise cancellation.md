Bose is bringing an end to the long-running saga of complaints regarding noise cancellation issues with its Quiet Comfort 35 and Quiet Comfort 35 II Bluetooth headphones. After spending months looking into reports of reduced NC performance — something many customers have blamed on firmware updates — Bose has concluded that firmware isn't responsible for the perceived drop in noise cancellation effectiveness. But it's going to let QC35 owners downgrade back to older firmware if they want to, which is an option that the company had previously supported, but later pulled amid all this controversy.
