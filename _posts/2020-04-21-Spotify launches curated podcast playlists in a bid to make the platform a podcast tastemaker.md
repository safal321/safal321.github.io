Spotify's officially trying to solve the podcast discovery problem while also trying to help podcasters reach new audiences. The company announced today that it's rolling out three human-curated podcast playlists in six countries: the US, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Mexico, and Brazil. The three weekly playlists are called Best Podcasts of the Week, Brain Snacks, and Crime Scene. They'll each be localized to the countries and will be populated by curators in each location. Spotify hired podcast curators around the world specifically for this feature.
