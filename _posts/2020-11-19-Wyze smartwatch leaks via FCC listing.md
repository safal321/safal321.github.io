Budget smart home company Wyze is preparing to release a smartwatch, according to a newly published Federal Communications Commission certification listing spotted by Twitter user @iJRPN. Other than its Apple Watch-esque rounded rectangular design, the “Wyze Watch 44” listing doesn't reveal too much about the unannounced smartwatch. We're assuming the “44” in its name refers to it having a 44mm case size, and it appears to feature a set of sensors for heart rate tracking.
