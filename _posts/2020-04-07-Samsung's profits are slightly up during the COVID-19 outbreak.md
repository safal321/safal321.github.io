Samsung Electronics is one of the first major tech giants to announce earnings figures since the coronavirus pandemic broke out, and so far at least the company appears to have been relatively unaffected. In guidance released today, Samsung says its first-quarter revenue was approximately 55 trillion won ($44.9 billion), which would be a year-on-year increase of five percent. Operating profit is expected to rise three percent to 6.4 trillion won ($5.23 billion).
