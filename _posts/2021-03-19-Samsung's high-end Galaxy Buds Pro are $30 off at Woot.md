Woot is offering the first sizable discount on Samsung's new Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds that were introduced a few months ago alongside the Galaxy S21 phones. Originally $200, they're $170, and you can choose between three colors: violet, silver, or black. Samsung makes a few sets of truly wireless earbuds that look similar, but these ones have the best sound quality the company has achieved yet.
