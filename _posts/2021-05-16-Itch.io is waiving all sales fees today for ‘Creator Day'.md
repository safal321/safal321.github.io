Indie game storefront Itch.io is waiving sales fees on everything today, May 14th, as part of the company's first Creator Day. Anyone selling things on the diverse storefront (which includes everything from indie games to music to entire magazines) will be able to keep “100 percent of sales after taxes and payment processor fees.” It's similar to Bandcamp's monthly creator program Bandcamp Fridays (although Itch.io hasn't said on what schedule it'll run the promotion in the future).
