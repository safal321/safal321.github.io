If you're having trouble concentrating on your work during self-quarantine, a set of quality noise-canceling headphones might be a good solution. You'll likely get a lot of use out of them in the coming weeks (possibly months) at home. Best Buy is offering a $150 discount on Microsoft's Surface Headphones, which are over-ear, noise-canceling wireless headphones. These usually cost $350, but now they're $200.
