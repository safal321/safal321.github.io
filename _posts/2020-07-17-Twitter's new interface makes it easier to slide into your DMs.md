Twitter has unveiled a new interface for its direct messages on the web, allowing you to send and receive DMs without having to leave your timeline. While currently you have to open up a separate section of Twitter's website to look at your DMs, now you'll be able to access them from a pop-up window to the bottom right of your timeline. From Twitter's video, it looks like a similar interface to what the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn currently offer for DMs on their platforms.
