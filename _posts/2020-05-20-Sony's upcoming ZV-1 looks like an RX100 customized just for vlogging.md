Sony Alpha just tweeted out a teaser for a camera announcement coming on May 26th. All Sony will say is that it's a “new compact camera” along with a hazy outline of some sort of camera, likely with an articulating screen. Luckily, we don't need to guess what it is because Sony Alpha Rumors recently dropped the details. It's almost surely the Sony ZV-1, and if Sony Alpha Rumors' leaked specs are correct, it looks like an ideal compact vlogging camera.
