Microsoft is expanding its Project xCloud service to the iPhone today. The software giant is launching a beta of xCloud through Apple's TestFlight service, allowing xCloud testers to try the service on an iPhone or iPad. It's the first time we've seen a cloud game streaming service appear on iOS since the days of OnLive. Google's Stadia and Nvidia's GeForce Now are still not available on Apple's devices.
