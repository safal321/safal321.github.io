Alienware is keen on giving Razer a run for its money when it comes to making a super-thin gaming laptop. Two of the configurations of Alienware's new X15 flagship model are actually 15.9mm thick, almost the same as Razer's just-refreshed 15.8mm-thick Blade 15 Advanced. That's impressively thin, especially considering that Alienware doesn't usually try to compete in this realm.
