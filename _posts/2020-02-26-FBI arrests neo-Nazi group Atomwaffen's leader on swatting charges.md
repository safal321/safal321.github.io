The Federal Bureau of Investigation has arrested a founder of violent neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, charging him with making interstate threats during a “swatting” campaign. John Cameron Denton allegedly joined a ring of racists who made hoax calls against a university, a church, and many other targets. He's also been described as Atomwaffen's leader by ProPublica — which Denton is accused of swatting in retaliation.
