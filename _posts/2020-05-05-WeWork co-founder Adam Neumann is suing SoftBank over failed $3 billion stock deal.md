WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann is suing investor SoftBank for scrapping a $3 billion stock buyout agreement. The New York Times reports that Neumann accused SoftBank of breaching its contract and “secretly taking actions to undermine” the agreement, which SoftBank abandoned last month. He's looking to merge the case with a similar suit by WeWork's board in April, but SoftBank has called those claims a “desperate and misguided attempt” to rewrite the deal's history.
