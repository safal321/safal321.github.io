Not long ago, Logitech's Brio webcam (along with almost any other kind of webcam made by reputable companies) was impossible to find. We're now at the point where you can get $40 off this 4K model through Lenovo, knocking it down to $160 instead of $200. It's still a big investment, but if you stream or just want to look your best in a meeting, this is one of the best choices out there to suit those needs.
