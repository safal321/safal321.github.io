Oculus has knocked $100 off the cost of its Rift S tethered virtual reality headset, which brings the price down to $299. This makes it the same price as the Oculus Quest 2 standalone headset that doesn't require connecting to a PC to play games and experiences â€” yet the Rift S doesn't require a Facebook account to use it. Oculus announced earlier this year that it discontinued the Rift S, so this discount could be its way of clearing out stock. You can get this price at several retailers, including on Oculus' site, Lenovo (the headset's manufacturer), as well as Walmart and Amazon.
