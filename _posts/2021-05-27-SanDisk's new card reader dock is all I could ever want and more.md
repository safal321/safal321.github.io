Western Digital, owner of the SanDisk brand, has announced a new product called the Pro-Dock 4, and it's all I've ever wanted in a card reading solution: it lets you mix and match four card reading modules, which can all be read simultaneously, and connect them all to your computer using a single Thunderbolt 3 cable. This dock not only fills the hole that was left in my heart by Lexar's Workflow hub, but it makes me completely forget it existed: the Workflow didn't have Thunderbolt daisy-chaining or a 260W power supply for charging devices and accessories (though I will admit that Lexar's SSD modules were kind of neat).
