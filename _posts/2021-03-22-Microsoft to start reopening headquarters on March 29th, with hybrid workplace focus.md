Microsoft is planning to start reopening its Redmond, Seattle headquarters later this month. The software giant originally started encouraging employees to work from home more than a year ago, just as the coronavirus pandemic began, and the company's main US offices have remained closed for months as a result. This will start to change on March 29th, with a limited reopening of Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Seattle.
