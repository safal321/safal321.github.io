The new 11-inch iPad Pro with the M1 processor costs $799 to preorder at most retailers, but not at Walmart. You can reserve an 11-inch model with 128GB of storage for $749, and it'll arrive at your door on or before June 1st. The step-up configuration with 256GB of storage is $50 off, too, costing $849 to preorder. We've seen similar preorder deals on the new iPad Pro from a site called Expercom, but it currently offers a vague “3-6 week” estimate for shipping your purchase.
