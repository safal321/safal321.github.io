Samsung is a dominant force when it comes to TV market share in living rooms, and now, the company wants to extend that success to the outdoors. Today, Samsung is announcing the Terrace, the latest TV in its “lifestyle” family that includes the Serif, Frame, and Sero. The Terrace is designed for outside viewing: it's IP55 water and dust resistant, and the screen can crank up to a brightness of 2000 nits to help you see everything even when the sun's out.
