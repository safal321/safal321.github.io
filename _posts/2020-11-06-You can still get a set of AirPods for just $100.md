There are a few deals we posted yesterday that are worth repeating again today. Notably, you still have a chance to get Apple AirPods wireless earbuds for $100, which is the lowest price yet. These normally cost around $120. Amazon is one of the retailers offering this deal, and if you're a Costco member, you can nab the deal online or in-store if you'd rather shop there. It's worth noting that this AirPods model ships with a wired charging case, not the $160 set that includes a wireless charging case. But given that they're the same product, charging case aside, this is a great deal to jump on today.
