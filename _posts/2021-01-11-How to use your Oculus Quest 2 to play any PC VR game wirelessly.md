One of the best features of the Oculus Quest 2 is it can be manually linked via USB to your gaming PC to play more demanding VR games you couldn't otherwise run natively on the headset. That's great if you want a way to play games like Half-Life: Alyx, but the obvious downside is that you're now physically tethered to a PC â€” so much for the wireless freedom that the Quest 2 advertises.
