Google today announced that it's adding a popular customer request to its Google TV software: separate profiles for kids. Kid profiles will let you choose which apps are available to young viewers. If a Google account for the child already exists, you can add that as a kid profile â€” but a Google account is not required; you can also create a profile simply by adding a child's name and age.
