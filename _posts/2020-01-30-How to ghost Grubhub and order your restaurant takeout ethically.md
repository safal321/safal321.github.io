Online food delivery services can often provide a valuable service, especially when you plan to order ahead, put in a larger order, have specific dietary requests, are unable to pick up an order, or can only pay with a credit card. For restaurants, it can also be helpful to receive electronic orders rather than take them over the phone during rush hours. (Disclosure: my parents own a small restaurant business and are listed on Grubhub / Seamless, so I am familiar with the way the relationship works.)
