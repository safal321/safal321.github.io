Alongside the new Galaxy S21 phones and Galaxy Buds Pro, Samsung is announcing a small Bluetooth gadget you can use for locating lost items, just like Tile. It's called the Galaxy SmartTag, and it will ship beginning on January 29th. It will retail for $29.99, but there's a decent chance that people who buy a Galaxy S21 phone will end up with some sort of bundled deal that gets it included with purchase.
