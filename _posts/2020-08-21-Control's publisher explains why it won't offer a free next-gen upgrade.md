Today, 505 Games is attempting to clear the air with a blog post about why it won't be offering owners of the original Control game a free next-gen upgrade when that version releases in 2021. It comes after last week's announcement that Control: Ultimate Edition, the $39.99 release that bundles the base game with all of the downloadable content, will give players on PS4 or Xbox One a free upgrade to the next-gen version. 505 caused some backlash when it said it won't offer any such upgrade to people who bought the original copy of the game released in 2019.
