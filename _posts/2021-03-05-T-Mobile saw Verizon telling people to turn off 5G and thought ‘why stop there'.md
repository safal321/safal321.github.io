T-Mobile has been busy hawking its 5G network, recently spending many additional billions to expand it, which makes it kinda awkward that it's also been caught telling users to turn off 5G to save battery life (via Sascha Segan). Didn't Verizon just make this same gaff mere days ago? It sure did. But instead of learning from the example, T-Mobile appears to have pulled a hold-my-beer: where Verizon told users to switch to LTE, many of T-Mobile's support documents tell users to go all the way back to 2G.
