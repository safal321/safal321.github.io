Harry Potter: Wizards Unite — the Pokxc3xa9mon Go-esque augmented reality Harry Potter game — is a game uniquely unsuited to the current world of self-quarantining people looking to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Unlike most video games, which are thriving right now due to the captive audience of bored people stuck inside, Wizards Unite (much like Pokxc3xa9mon Go) is a game almost entirely based around exploring outdoors and meeting up with other players in public spaces — the exact sort of thing that people are supposed to avoid doing right now.
