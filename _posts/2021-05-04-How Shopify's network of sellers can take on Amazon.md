Today I'm talking to Harley Finkelstein, president of Shopify. Shopify is one of those companies that makes the modern internet go — it makes software that allows businesses of all sizes to set up online stores, and from there it can handle everything from shipping orders to financing loans for expansion. The company went public in 2015, and as online commerce has exploded during the pandemic, it's been on a tear ever since — it just posted $988 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, a 110 percent increase from last year.
