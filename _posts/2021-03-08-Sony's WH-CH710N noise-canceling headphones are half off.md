Not all of Sony's noise-canceling over-ear headphones are costly. You can get a good deal today on the WH-CH710N in either gray or black at Best Buy. At Amazon, you can find those colors, with an additional blue-colored option. Each store is selling this model for $98 instead of $200, which is $10 shy of the best-ever price during Black Friday 2020. According to my colleague Chris Welch's post covering their announcement, these have an “Artificial Intelligence Noise Cancellation” feature, which Sony says automatically chooses the right noise cancellation mode depending on the sound levels in your environment. Sony claims up to 35 hours of battery life per charge.
