Amazon just wrapped up its fall hardware event, and it was packed with a number of big announcements. There were a number of new Echo devices, such as a spherical redesign of the tried-and-true Echo. Amazon also showed off improvements for Alexa, including new security features. We saw a bunch of new Ring devices â€” one of which was a drone that can autonomously fly around your home. And Amazon finally took the wraps off its long-rumored cloud gaming service, Luna.
