You can grab two unlocked OnePlus 8T phones for $1,124 on OnePlus' website today only. It's a deal worth highlighting: the OnePlus 8T usually costs $749, but if you buy two today, you'll get them for $562 each. This deal also includes a set of OnePlus Buds wireless earbuds with each phone at no extra charge. For a phone that was released just a few weeks ago, this is a great deal.
