Summer Game Fest is back this year, and it will start on June 10th with an event called “Kick Off Live!” that's billed as a “spectacular world premiere showcase” with “more than a dozen” world premieres and announcements. The show, which will begin at 2PM ET, will be hosted by Geoff Keighley, who you might also know as the host of The Game Awards.
