Google has tweaked its Maps app to highlight restaurants that are offering takeout and delivery options during the COVID-19 pandemic, 9to5Google reports. When you open the Maps app, you'll now find shortcuts on the home screen, and you can tap them to find relevant restaurants close to you. These include local restaurants as well as chains. In some cases, you'll also be able to order food from within the app, but only if a restaurant supports Google's functionality.
