The Good Fight returned to its very weird and funny roots this week and introduced Mandy Patinkin as a — let's say “unconventional” judge, and it's as if my favorite character from Homeland got a new job. I know everyone is probably maxed out on how many streaming channels they can/want to subscribe to, but The Good Fight is reason enough to at least check out Paramount Plus. And I have no idea what's going to happen on the next episode of Loki but (mild spoiler ahead!) I can't imagine the two characters who got pruned will stay pruned.
