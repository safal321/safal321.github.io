Valve and five PC video game publishers have been fined a total of xe2x82xac7.8 million (around $9.5 million) by the European Commission for restricting cross-border game sales in the European Economic Area. The Commission said that the companies geo-blocked around 100 PC video games, preventing them from being activated and played outside certain EU countries. This broke the EU's Digital Single Market rules which prohibit those types of barriers.
