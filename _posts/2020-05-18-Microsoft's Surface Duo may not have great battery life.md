Microsoft's Surface Duo is meant to be a showcase for its unique, dual-screen design, so it may be a bit more forgivable that its specs don't include the latest and greatest components or anything all that impressive by way of battery life and storage. According to Windows Central, the phone will ship with the older Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 (which we knew last year when it was announced), a rather small 3,460mAh battery considering it's powering two screens, and storage options of 64GB or 256GB.
