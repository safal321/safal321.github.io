The last few weeks have seen the release of Samsung's Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and Note 20, Galaxy Z Fold 2, Galaxy Z Flip 5G, Galaxy Watch 3, a couple tablets, and more — but the company still isn't finished with events just yet. There will be yet another Samsung Unpacked virtual presentation on September 23rd at 10AM ET. This one is titled “Galaxy Unpacked for Every Fan,” which is a fairly obvious hint that it will mark the official reveal of the rumored Galaxy S20 Fan Edition.
