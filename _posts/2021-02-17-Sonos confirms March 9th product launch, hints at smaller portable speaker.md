Sonos will announce its next new product on March 9th, the company confirmed today. The invite for the launch shows a person out in a field â€” strongly hinting that the device will be portable. My guess is it's something that would fit in that shoulder bag. A recent Federal Communications Commission filing from Sonos revealed that it's preparing to release what looks like a smaller battery-powered speaker. Documents show the device to use Bluetooth and have a wireless charging stand much like the existing Sonos Move, which sells for $399.
