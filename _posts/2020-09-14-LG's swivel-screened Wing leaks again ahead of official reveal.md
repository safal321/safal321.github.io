Wing, LG's unannounced smartphone with a main display that swivels to reveal a smaller secondary screen, has leaked again in a series of renders published on Twitter by Evan Blass. The images show a couple of different use cases for LG's unusual form factor, including watching video on the main screen while the playback controls appear on the secondary display, and displaying two apps side by side. The new phone is due to be revealed at 10AM ET today.
