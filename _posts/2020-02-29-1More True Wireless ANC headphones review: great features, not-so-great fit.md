1More is a smaller headphones brand that's behind some of the best midrange wired earbuds available. Now, as the headphone market continues to run away from anything that so much as looks like a wire, 1More is running alongside them. Last year, it announced its first pair of true wireless earbuds, and now it's got a noise-canceling model. They're the appropriately titled 1More True Wireless ANC headphones, and they're available now for $199.99.
