I woke up feeling a little strange this morning, but I didn't think much of it. It's just another day living in the pandemic. But after I got some strange looks at the cafe, I started to get a little worried. On my way home, I took a sip of my coffee and somehow pierced through the paper cup with bottom fangs that I didn't have yesterday. I ran to the bathroom mirror when I got inside, only to discover that I'd turned into an ork. Awesome!
