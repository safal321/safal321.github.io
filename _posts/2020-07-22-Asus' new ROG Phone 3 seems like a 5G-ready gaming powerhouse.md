Asus' new ROG Phone 3 aims to be the pinnacle of smartphones if you're serious about gaming and having the fastest specs. The device features a 6.59-inch OLED HDR color-calibrated screen that has a fast 144Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time. It's powered by the Snapdragon 865 Plus chipset with 5G support, and it can be configured with up to 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 3.1 ROM storage. Both of those specs push the boundaries of what we've seen so far in a phone. Lastly, the ROG Phone 3 features a big 6,000mAh battery, as did last year's model.
