The Beats Solo Pro wireless on-ear headphones with active noise cancellation are $230 at Best Buy and Amazon, which is $20 cheaper than the best deal we've seen. This is Beats' latest model, and it's just about as capable as Sony and Bose's flagship model in terms of build quality and battery life, despite now costing considerably less. It's worth noting that these charge via Lightning port, so while you can connect them wirelessly to any Bluetooth device, they're clearly angled toward people who are at least a little bit entrenched in Apple's world.
