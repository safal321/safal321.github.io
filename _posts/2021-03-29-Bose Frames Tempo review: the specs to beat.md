It's still fair to call audio sunglasses a niche category, but with Bose offering several models, Amazon in the game, and counting recent announcements from Razer and JLab, it's certainly a growing one. There are people out there who just aren't particularly fond of earbuds â€” often because they dislike the feeling of silicone tips plugging up their ears. Open-style products like the standard AirPods and Galaxy Buds Live are one alternative, but then you still face the possibility of losing them. If you're running on a trail or out for an intense bike ride, it's not an insignificant risk.
