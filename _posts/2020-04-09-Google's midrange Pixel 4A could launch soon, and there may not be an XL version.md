There have been rumors and leaks aplenty about the Google Pixel 4A, but they're starting to bubble up even more today. 9to5Google published what it claims is a complete set of specs for the Pixel 4A, and most intriguing of all, it says that Google won't be releasing a Pixel 4A XL. The Pixel 4A will instead split the difference in size between the prior models, with a 5.8-inch display that's a little larger than the 5.6-inch Pixel 3A but slightly smaller than the 6-inch Pixel 3A XL.
