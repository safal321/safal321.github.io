Motorola is kicking off 2021 with refreshes for its midrange Moto G lineup of phones with new versions of the Moto G Power, Moto G Stylus, and Moto G Play that promise low prices and days of battery life across the board. There's also a new member of the Motorola One family called the Motorola One 5G Ace, which, at $399, takes the crown as Motorola's cheapest 5G phone yet.
