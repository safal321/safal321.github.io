Electric bikes, like cars, come in tiers of quality and prestige. Dependable commuter bikes start at around $1,000. At $1,500, they start to look nice, with batteries and motors integrated into the overall aesthetic. Above $2,000 you start seeing sleek designs, advanced electronics, and a preponderance of high-end or original components. On that scale, VanMoof's premium prices have made it the BMW of e-bikes (or Tesla, if you prefer).
