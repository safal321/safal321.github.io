I have a love-hate relationship with my iPhone. I love the hardware, Apple's attention to detail in iOS, and the quality of apps that developers have created. But I hate Apple's walled garden that limits how I use my iPhone every day. I can't change my default browser; every time I click an email address, I'm forced into an inferior iOS email client; and Apple's tight OS restrictions mean customization and app features are limited compared to Android.
