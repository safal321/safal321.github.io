Among the monitors Dell has announced at this year's CES is the Dell UltraSharp 40 Curved WUHD U4021QW, which it's claiming is the “world's first 40-inch ultrawide curved WUHD (5K2K) monitor.” 5K2K, in case you were wondering, translates to a pixel resolution of 5120 x 2160. That gives it the same vertical pixel count as a typical 4K screen, but with an ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio. By the standards of most monitors, it's a lot of pixels.
