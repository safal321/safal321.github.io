We're now at a point where you can comfortably describe the Nintendo Switch as “mature.” It's no longer a new device, but one several years into its life, with a robust and varied line-up of games available. There's a good chance you picked up a Switch to play one of Nintendo's tentpole franchises — whether that's Super Mario, Animal Crossing, or Pokxc3xa9mon — but there are a lot of different kinds of experiences available on the tablet. That includes big social titles, classic games, and inventive indie releases. Heck, one of my favorite experiences this year has been relearning chess on the Switch.
