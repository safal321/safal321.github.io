Sennheiser is today introducing a lower-cost set of true wireless earbuds that slot in below the company's flagship Momentum True Wireless 2. At $199.95, the new “CX 400BT True Wireless” — so much for simple names, eh Sennheiser? — aim to retain the strong sound quality of the pricier set, though you're losing out on active noise cancellation.
