The Segway Max is probably a good fit for you if you're looking for an electric scooter that can travel up to 40 miles per charge â€” far longer than most other models. The Max happens to be cheaper than ever at Wellbots, but just for readers of The Verge. The retailer is offering you a $100 discount, dropping the usual $799 price down to $699. Just enter the offer code THEVERGEMAX after the checkout screen to see the price drop further than we've seen before.
