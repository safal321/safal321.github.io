Fairphone, the sustainable smartphone manufacturer that tries to make easily repairable devices using responsibly sourced materials, has announced its latest handset. The Fairphone 3 Plus is an upgraded version of last year's Fairphone 3 with improved cameras and speakers. More interestingly, though, if you already bought last year's phone and don't want to upgrade to a whole new handset, then Fairphone's modular design means you can purchase the new camera module on its own and install it into your existing phone.
