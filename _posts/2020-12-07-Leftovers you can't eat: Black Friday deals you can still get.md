This weekend, you can enjoy the last of the leftovers â€” not Thanksgiving leftovers. (There's still no end in sight for those at my house.) I'm talking about the deals left over from Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It's a relative drought compared to the number of sales we saw last weekend in the thick of it all, but you can still get some of this year's best prices on headphones, video games, and smart speakers.
