Microsoft is improving its OneDrive upload limit and sharing integration with Microsoft Teams for businesses and finally bringing a dark mode to the web version. The software giant is increasing the upload file size limit from 15GB to 100GB for all OneDrive and SharePoint users today. It's a useful addition for business users of OneDrive who have been restricted to 15GB files, making it difficult to sync some large file types like CAD or video files.
