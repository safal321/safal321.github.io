Geely, the Chinese parent company of Volvo, announced the launch of “new electric mobility technology and solutions company” called Zeekr. The company, which is China's largest private automaker, reportedly will invest $300 million into the new venture to start out. It's the latest in a string of deals for Geely that includes satellites, drones, trucking, and partnerships with major firms like Baidu, Tencent, and Foxconn. (The news about Zeekr was first reported by Reuters last week.)
