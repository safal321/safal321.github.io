Nintendo and Champion are attempting to turn Mario into a style icon with a new collaboration. As part of Super Mario's 35th anniversary, the two companies have announced a limited edition capsule collection that mashes streetwear with the Mushroom Kingdom. The highlight is a pair of bright red overalls, but there's also a tie-dye Toad shirt, T-shirts with classic Mario box art, and a Princess Peach hoodie.
