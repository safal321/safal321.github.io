All indications point to Samsung introducing its next set of true wireless earbuds at the company's Unpacked event next month. We've already seen them, and they'll reportedly be branded as the Galaxy Buds Live. (It's truly foolish of Samsung to not just own the design and call them the Galaxy Beans, but I digress.)
