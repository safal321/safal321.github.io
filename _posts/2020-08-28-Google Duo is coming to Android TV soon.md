After announcing Chromecast support for Google Meet, Google has now revealed that the company's consumer video chat app, Duo, will be coming to Android TV in the form of a native app that lets users start video calls from their TV screen. A beta of Google Duo for Android TV will be released “in the coming weeks.” You can launch both one-on-one and group video calls with the app. “If your TV doesn't have a camera built-in, you can simply plug in a USB camera,” Google said in its blog post — assuming your TV supports such a thing.
