The Chinese government has ordered ByteDance to take down its Feishu workplace messaging tool from app stores in China for a month because it let users access posts from Facebook and Twitter, which are banned in the country, Bloomberg reported. ByteDance, which also operates the social media app TikTok, developed Feishu as an internal app, then marketed it for business use in 2019. An international version of the app, called Lark, launched in April 2019 and is still operating in markets like Japan and Singapore.
