There's a great site-wide deal happening for a limited time at eBay on, well, a lot of things. The offer code PICKSUMMER15 is active through May 16th (ending 11:59PM PT) and knocks 15 percent off your purchase total when applied (via Android Police). The code will automatically show up at checkout when you have eligible products in your cart, but you'll need to check the box to activate it. The terms state that you can use it two times, which is impressive.
