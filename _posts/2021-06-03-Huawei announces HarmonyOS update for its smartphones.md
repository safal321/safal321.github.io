Huawei has announced that its HarmonyOS operating system is coming to its smartphones via a forthcoming update. Huawei's consumer business CEO Richard Yu says the company is updating around 100 of its devices globally to the new operating system, which also includes tablets like the MatePad Pro. In theory, it's a big change from its previous phones, which have run the open-source version of Android with Huawei's own services replacing the Google software it's been unable to include on new devices as a result of US sanctions.
