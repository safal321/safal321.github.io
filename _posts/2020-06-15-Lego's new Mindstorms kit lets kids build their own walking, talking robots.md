Lego's Mindstorms Robot Inventor kit is a new set that lets kids build and design robots. You get 949 pieces as part of the kit, which includes a color sensor, distance sensor, four motors, and Lego's Bluetooth-enabled “Intelligent Hub.” It's designed as a way to teach children basic STEM skills, including programming, and it's the first new entry in the Mindstorms lineup in seven years.
