There is no shortage of devices that you can stick on your bedside table to use as a voice-controlled alarm clock. You can, of course, just use your phone, but you can also put a small smart speaker, such as Amazon's Echo Dot, Google's Nest Mini, or Apple's new HomePod mini there and bark commands at it to set an alarm, tell you the weather, or snooze for ten minutes. If you want something more fully featured, devices like the Echo Show 5, Lenovo Smart Clock, or Google's Nest Hub have full-color touchscreen displays that can play video, show camera feeds, or be used as a digital picture frame.
