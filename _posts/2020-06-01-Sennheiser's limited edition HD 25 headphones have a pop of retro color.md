In celebration of the company's 75th anniversary, Sennheiser is releasing a limited edition version of its HD 25 headphones. While they usually feature a nondescript all-black design, the limited edition will come with an extra pair of bright yellow ear pads inspired by Sennheiser's other iconic headphones, the HD 414. The company is also reducing the price of the headphones while it's selling the limited edition models, from $149.95 to $99.95.
