TikTok is seemingly thriving during the global pandemic, and today, analytics platform Sensor Tower reported that the social media platform has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally. It was downloaded 315 million times this quarter alone in the App Store and Google Play combined. Notably, these app download figures don't account for third-party app stores that are popular in China. Sensor Tower says India, China, and the US are the countries that account for the most downloads. (It's also worth keeping in mind that downloads don't indicate active users.)
