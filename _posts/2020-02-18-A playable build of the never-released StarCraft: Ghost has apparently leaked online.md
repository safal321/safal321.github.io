Over the weekend, a video and screenshots that appeared to come from a playable Xbox build of the never-released StarCraft: Ghost leaked online. It's a fascinating piece of gaming history. StarCraft: Ghost was a third-person shooter set in the Blizzard' StarCraft universe that was supposed to be released on the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 but never saw the light of day due to a rocky, years-long development history (which you can read all about in this great feature from Polygon).
