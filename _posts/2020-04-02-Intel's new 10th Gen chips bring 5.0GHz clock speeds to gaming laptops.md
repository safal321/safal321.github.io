Intel is announcing the next wave of its Core processors, and it's finally bringing out the big guns, with its first 10th Gen Comet Lake H-series processors for laptops. They're Intel's beefiest, most powerful, and most demanding chips, designed to go in high-end gaming laptops and creative machines for users who need the most power. The new chips have a TDP of 45W, with clock speeds that can boost past 5.0GHz, a first for Intel's processors.
