If you use Waze and ever needed to take your eyes off the road to control your music alongside your maps, a new update is starting to roll out that should let you spend more time driving and less time fiddling with that touchscreen. MacRumors is reporting that Waze has started rolling out Apple CarPlay Dashboard support, which will allow you to see directions on CarPlay's home screen, alongside media controls, calendar events, and more. When I heard about it, I ran out to my car and sure enough, Waze's directions showed up on the home screen.
