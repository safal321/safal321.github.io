If you've been waiting on a good deal for the latest Apple Watch, today might be delivering that for you â€” if you really wanted the all-red version. The 40mm-sized Apple Watch Series 6 with a red sport band and red aluminum case costs $299 at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, down from its original $399 price. At $299, it's just a $20 jump from the $279 Apple Watch SE to get a better smartwatch with slightly faster specs. The big differences in the Series 6 include its always-on display, its ability to take blood oxygen readings, and it has the U1 ultra wideband chip.
