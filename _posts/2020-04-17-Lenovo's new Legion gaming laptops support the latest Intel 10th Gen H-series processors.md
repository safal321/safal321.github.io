Lenovo has announced several new products to join its fleet of Legion gaming products, and as you'll notice throughout this post, it's also simplifying its naming conventions. On the high end, the new Legion 7 features support for Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q graphics chips and Intel's new 10th Gen i9 H-series processors, following announcements earlier this month that other manufacturers like MSI, Razer, Asus, and others are doing the same.
