We were warned. But as is so often the case, our feeble minds couldn't fully grasp it until it was staring us in the face. We saw the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra's camera bump in a pre-announcement unboxing video, so we knew what was likely in store: an absolutely massive bump with three rear-facing cameras next to a 1-inch screen. But now that the phone has officially launched and we've seen it from more angles, we can confirm that it is actually the Death Star of camera bumps.
