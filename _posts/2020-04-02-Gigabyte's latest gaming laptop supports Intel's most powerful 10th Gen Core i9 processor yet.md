Gigabyte has introduced three new versions of its Aorus gaming laptops: the Aorus 15G, 17G, and 17X. Each features the newly announced Intel 10th Gen Comet Lake H-series processors, and you'll be able to choose between the eight-core Intel Core i7-10875H and the high-end Intel Core i9-10980HK. These are also Gigabyte's first gaming laptops to include Nvidia's new RTX 20-series Super mobile graphics chips, and they're configurable to feature the RTX 2080 Super Max-Q chip.
