The history of cinema is littered with racist stereotypes. (Call it the long tail of minstrel shows.) As cultural preferences have evolved — which is to say it's now not cool to be racist — so have our films. In practice, what that means is some stuff just doesn't hold up, especially when you're showing it to kids. According to Disney, that includes classics like Peter Pan and Dumbo. Disney Plus will now not show those two films and some others to profiles that indicate the viewer is seven years old or younger. Other blocked movies include Aristocats, Lady and the Tramp, The Swiss Family Robinson, and The Jungle Book.
