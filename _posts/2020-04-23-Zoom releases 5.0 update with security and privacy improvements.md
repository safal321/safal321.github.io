Zoom promised a 90-day feature freeze to fix privacy and security issues, and the company is delivering on some of those promises. A new Zoom 5.0 update is rolling out this week that's designed to address some of the many complaints that Zoom has faced in recent weeks. With this new update, there's now a security icon that groups together a number of Zoom's security features. You can use it to quickly lock meetings, remove participants, and restrict screen sharing and chatting in meetings.
