At 26.5 grams and the size of my thumb, Insta360's latest action camera, the Go 2, looks like an oversized Tic Tac with an eyeball. It's the second generation in the Go lineup, which is Insta360's only non-360-degree camera line. Where the first-generation Go left a lot to be desired, particularly in the image quality department, the $299 Go 2 comes with a new charging case, larger sensor, and improved image quality, making a strong case for a mobile-first action camera.
