Disney is going all-in on Baby Yoda merch. The line, inspired by the character (who is actually named “The Child,” but that's not really meme-friendly) from The Mandalorian, includes everything from plush toys and animatronic dolls to a Bluetooth speaker of Baby Yoda's head. Do I love that the actual speaker looks like a trypophobia disaster? Not at all. Will I play some Mr. Worldwide out of this curious portable head? Absolutely.
