Amazon's Luna streaming service has arrived, with the company rolling out early access to a limited set of customers today. It's starting with a library of 50 games and support for Mac, PC, Fire TV, and, in a first for a major streaming service, iOS devices â€” because Amazon has a web app that circumvents Apple's controversial App Store rules. Luna starts at $5.99 a month.
