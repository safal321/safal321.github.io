At Dell, several laptops (and really, many other devices, like desktops, monitors, and more) are 17 percent off if you add the offer code SAVE17 to your cart at checkout. (The offer seems to stack if you're buying more than one product.) One of those laptops is the Dell G5 15 SE gaming laptop. Normally $1,300, it's down to $1,081 with the offer code applied before tax. This is the top-end model offered by Dell, with AMD's powerful Ryzen 4800H processor, a Radeon 5600M graphics chip, 16GB of RAM, 1TB of fast PCIe SSD storage, and a 1080p display that has a 144Hz refresh rate.
