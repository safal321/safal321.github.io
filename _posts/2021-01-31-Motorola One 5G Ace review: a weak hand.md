The Motorola One 5G Ace is a $399.99 phone that does a somewhat convincing impression of a more expensive phone. It's large, which feels like a flagship kind of thing, even if that's not strictly true. It's relatively heavy, which, in keeping with the wisdom of Jurassic Park's unluckiest lawyer, means it's probably expensive. It's shiny. I held it up for a friend to look at it from six feet away, and he described it as “sleek, like an old iPhone.” And of course, there's 5G, which was (until somewhat recently) reserved for premium devices.
