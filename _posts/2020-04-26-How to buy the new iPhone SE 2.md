The iPhone SE 2 is now available. If you were thinking about getting one, or are just curious about the various improvements over the 2016 model, check out Dieter Bohn's video review above. Suffice it to say, he liked it. The 2020 version of the iPhone SE has powerful specs, a surprisingly good camera in daylight, and features that you don't usually get with a $399 phone. It has wireless charging, IP67 water resistance, and more. It's even compatible with iPhone 8 cases.
