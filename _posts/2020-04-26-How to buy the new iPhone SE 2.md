If you were thinking about getting one, or are just curious about the various improvements over the 2016 model, check out Dieter Bohn's video review above. Suffice it to say, he liked it. The 2020 version of the iPhone SE has powerful specs, a surprisingly good camera in daylight, and features that you don't usually get with a $399 phone. It has wireless charging, IP67 water resistance, and more. It's even compatible with iPhone 8 cases.<br/><br/>We've got all of the details below on how you can get one of these phones yourself. Whether you want to buy from Apple directly or want to find the best carrier deal to help you upgrade for far less than the phone's $399 retail cost, we have you covered.<br/><br/>n    Relatedn<br/><br/>Apple is selling the unlocked version of the new iPhone SE 2, starting with the 64GB version that costs $399. If you want more storage, the 128GB model costs $449 and another one that tops out at 256GB of storage is $549. At the moment, orders placed right now for the unlocked version are set to ship in mid-May.<br/><br/>Best Buy is also selling the unlocked iPhone SE 2, as well as phones tied to carriers like Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T. The costs are the same as Apple's listed above. You can order online to have your iPhone SE 2 delivered at home, or orders can be picked up at its physical stores via the company's curbside service starting on Friday, April 24th.<br/><br/>Walmart is selling the iPhone SE 2, and it's offering a great deal until mid-July for those who pay for the phone with a device payment plan with AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint. It's offering a flat $200 discount on the total cash price of the phone when paid on the device payment plan. You'll still pay your usual price for your phone plan, but you'll pay far less per month for the phone than it would usually cost elsewhere. It's offering the black, white, and red colors in all three storage configurations.<br/><br/>If you don't want to pay a lot per month for your monthly phone service, Visible, a carrier that's owned by Verizon and operates on its 4G LTE network, is offering a good deal if you buy the phone on its service. It will charge $384 for the 64GB version, but you'll get a $200 Mastercard credit voucher (as long as you haven't already received a gift card from a Visible promo in the past) alongside your purchase. This deal works for new and existing customers.<br/><br/>AT&T is offering a deal on the iPhone SE 2 if you add a new line for an unlimited plan and purchase the phone with an installment agreement. The phone will cost $5 per month (totaling just $150 once the payment plan is paid off), but you'll get the discount in the form of monthly credits sent to you over 30 months. Additionally, it's giving a $150 Visa card to those who order online and add a line to a new or existing unlimited plan.<br/><br/>AT&T subscribers who are upgrading can get a different deal at Sam's Club. If you upgrade to an iPhone SE 2 online on an AT&T unlimited plan with a device payment plan, you'll get a $100 Sam's Club gift card until May 8th. Until April 26th, you'll get an additional $100 off the total installment price of the phone, dropping the total cost of the 64GB model (after monthly credits are returned to you over 30 months) to $300.<br/><br/>The AT&T-owned Cricket MVNO is offering $50 off the cost of a new iPhone SE 2 when you purchase the phone. No trade-in or new line activation is required. This $50 off promotion applies to all storage configurations, bringing down the prices to $349 for the 64GB model, $399 for the 128GB configuration, and $499 for the 256GB device.<br/><br/>T-Mobile will offer an iPhone SE for free when you open a new line and trade in an older iPhone. Alternatively, you can just trade in your older iPhone for up to half off the cost of the $399 iPhone SE. The carrier will offer up to $200 in credit for the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8, and their Plus-sized configurations. It will give you $100 toward the purchase of the iPhone SE if you trade in the iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus.<br/><br/>Correction: This post originally stated that you could claim up to $300 for a new phone purchase from Visible. In fact, the promotion is limited to up to $200. We regret the error.<br/><br/>Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.
