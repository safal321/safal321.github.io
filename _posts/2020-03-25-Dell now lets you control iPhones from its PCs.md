If you're an iPhone user with a modern Dell computer, you can now mirror your phone's screen to your PC and control it using Dell's Mobile Connect app. Version 3 of the iOS app lets you control your phone using your PC's keyboard and mouse, and you can also drag and drop photo and video files to transfer them between the two devices. You can also now send SMS messages without needing to keep the iPhone app open in the foreground.
