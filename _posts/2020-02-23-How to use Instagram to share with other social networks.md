If you're an Instagram user, there's a good chance it isn't the only social network that you post to. The app makes it very easy to send your post to a number of other social networks â€” including Facebook (which owns Instagram). Back in 2018, as a result of the Cambridge Analytica breach, Facebook stopped allowing almost all third-party apps to post to its personal feeds (this didn't apply to business feeds), except for Instagram. So if you want to send a post to a bunch of services, including Facebook, Instagram may be your best bet.
