Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 is available for $550 from Microsoft's eBay store, its lowest price yet. Normally the phone costs $950 and previously we have seen the price go down to as low as $600. The price is available for all three color options, black, white, or the iridescent  Glow model. This is for an unlocked version of the phone that's compatible with all of the major LTE networks in the US. It also comes with a full US warranty.
