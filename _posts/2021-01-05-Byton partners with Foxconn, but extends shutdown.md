Chinese EV startup Byton has signed a manufacturing deal with iPhone-maker Foxconn, which according to Bloomberg could be worth around $200 million. In exchange, Foxconn — which has been eager to get into electric vehicles — will provide Byton with “advanced manufacturing technology, operation management expertise and supply chain resources.” The two will apparently work together to get Byton's M-Byte electric SUV across the finish line into production for the Chinese market in 2022.
