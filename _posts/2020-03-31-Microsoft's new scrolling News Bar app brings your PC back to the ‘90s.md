Microsoft has created a scrolling news bar app for Windows 10. It sits above the Windows taskbar and provides scrolling 24/7 news from more than 4,500 publications alongside customizable stock information. It's very similar to scrolling news apps we used to see in the â€˜90s for Windows PCs, and it was developed by Microsoft's internal News team (formerly MSN News).
