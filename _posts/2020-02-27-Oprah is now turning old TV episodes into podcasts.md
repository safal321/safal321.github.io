Oprah can't get enough podcasts. The famous talk show host and inspirational speaker announced yesterday that she'll be turning her old TV show episodes, dating back to the â€˜80s, into podcast episodes. Called The Oprah Winfrey Show: The Podcast, the show won't run every episode from the series; instead, it will feature certain selections. People reports that the first 10 episodes include now-famous guests like Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, and Suze Orman. Although the show has released a trailer, it doesn't include a release date. The show will be available across platforms and isn't an exclusive release.
