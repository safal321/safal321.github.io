Google is changing the data controller for its UK user data to Google LLC, placing the data under the jurisdiction of US regulators, the company announced today. The change is being made due to the UK's exit from the EU, which has created uncertainty around the future of data protection regulation in the country. Alongside the changes, Google is also updating its terms of service for users worldwide, which it says will make them easier for its users to understand.
