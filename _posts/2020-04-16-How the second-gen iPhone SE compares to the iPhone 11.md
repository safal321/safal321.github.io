After months of rumors, Apple has finally announced a new iPhone SE. The new phone looks a lot like the iPhone 8, as it has a 4.7-inch LCD screen, Touch ID, a glass back, and thick top and bottom bezels. But on the inside, it's powered by Apple's A13 Bionic chip, which is significantly more powerful than the iPhone 8's A11 Bionic chip and is also what's inside Apple's iPhone 11 series of phones. And the second-generation iPhone SE's $399 starting price makes it a lot cheaper than the iPhone 11.
