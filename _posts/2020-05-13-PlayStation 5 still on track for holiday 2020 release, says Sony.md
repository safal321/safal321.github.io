Sony says that the PlayStation 5 is “on track for launch in this holiday season” despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The company made the announcement as part of its fiscal 2019 earnings release today, where it also reported 14 percent lower gaming revenue year-on-year. Sony put the decline down to lower hardware and software sales, highlighting the importance of the upcoming PS5. The PS4 has now topped 110 million units sold worldwide.
