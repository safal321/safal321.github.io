Oppo has announced its first ever phone with wireless charging. The Ace 2 is the follow-up to last year's Reno Ace, which still holds the record for the world's fastest wired charging system in a shipping phone, but drops the “Reno” brand name. (Which is probably for the best, because that lineup was getting impossible to keep track of.)
