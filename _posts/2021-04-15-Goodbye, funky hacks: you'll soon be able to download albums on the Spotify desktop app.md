Spotify's desktop app refresh seems to be rolling out to users, and it brings with it a very handy feature: album downloads. The app has supported downloading playlists to your computer for quite a while. The update should make it easier to keep your library managed if you want to keep the music going even when you're offline. It is worth noting that this feature is limited to Premium subscribers â€” according to Spotify's documentation, free users are only able to download podcasts.
