Instagram is making it easier to address people by their defined pronouns. The company announced today that it's allowing people to add up to four pronouns to their profile, which they can then choose to display publicly or only to their followers. (Users under 18 will have this setting turned on by default.) Instagram says people can fill out a form to have a pronoun added, if it's not already available, or just add it to their bio instead. Instagram says this is available in a “few countries,” but doesn't specify further. We've reached out for more information and will update if we hear back.
