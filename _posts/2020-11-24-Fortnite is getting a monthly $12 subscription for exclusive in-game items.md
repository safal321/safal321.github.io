A new season of Fortnite is almost here, and alongside it, developer Epic is introducing a monthly subscription service called Fortnite Crew. For $11.99 each month Fortnite players will get 1,000 Vbucks (Fortnite's in-game currency), an exclusive character skin and gear, and access to the current season's battle pass. You can get a look at the first character offering in the image above.
