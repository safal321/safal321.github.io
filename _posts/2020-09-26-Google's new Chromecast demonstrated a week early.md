Google's new Chromecast device has leaked once again, giving us a detailed look at the TV dongle's hardware and user interface. The leak comes after Redditor u/fuzztub07 was able to buy the unannounced “Chromecast with Google TV” dongle early from a local Walmart. They've since published a series of photographs of the included hardware and its manual, as well as a video of its user interface.
