Spotify is now giving musicians the ability to highlight their fundraising efforts right on their dedicated artist landing pages. The company is launching its Artist Fundraising Pick feature that allows musicians to select a fundraising destination and place it front and center on their pages, like they can already do with any piece of music. Links can only come from certain partners, however: Cash App, GoFundMe, and PayPal.me. If artists aren't running their own fundraiser, they can also link out to any of the verified organizations participating in the Spotify COVID-19 Music Relief project.
