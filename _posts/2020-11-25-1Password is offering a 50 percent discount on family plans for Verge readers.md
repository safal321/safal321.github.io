In case you still don't use a password manager, or if you're looking to switch services, 1Password is offering an exclusive Black Friday offer to readers of The Verge until Thursday, December 3rd. You can save 50 percent each month on the cost of a family subscription (up to five people, and not restricted to a single household) to 1Password's services, costing $2.50 per month for up to one year. After that year is up, you'll be charged the regular $5 per month rate.
