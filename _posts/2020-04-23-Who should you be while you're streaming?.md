If there's anything I've learned from working on the internet, peddling writing for a number of years, it's that the content must flow. Or maybe it's better to say that content will flow because its creation is a foregone conclusion. No matter what your feelings on the issue are, there will always be more of it. And while the word used to be deployed as a synonym for low-quality art, the kind that's relatable and snackable and draws in huge undiscerning audiences, in recent years, it's come to encompass all creation. Content is a unit of measure, not necessarily a work itself.
