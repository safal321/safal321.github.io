The Philips Hue line is getting a few new products today, the most popular of which is likely to be a new bulb that's much brighter than typical Hue lights. The new bulb only comes in white — it doesn't do any fancy color temperature adjustments — but it offers light equivalent to a 100W bulb, whereas the standard white Hue bulb is only a 60W equivalent. Brightness has been a limitation of Hue bulbs, so this could help more people find what they want out of the smart lighting system.
