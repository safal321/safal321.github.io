Motorola has announced the One Fusion Plus, its second phone with a pop-up selfie camera, just six months after first including one on last year's Motorola One Hyper. Like its predecessor, it has a 6.5-inch 1080p display with no notch or hole-punch cutout, but the new phone features a number of internal and external improvements over the One Hyper.
