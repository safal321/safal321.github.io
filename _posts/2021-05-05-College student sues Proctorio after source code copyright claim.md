The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed a lawsuit against the remote testing company Proctorio on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson. The lawsuit is intended to “quash a campaign of harassment designed to undermine important concerns” about the company's remote test-proctoring software, according to the EFF. It's the latest legal battle for the software company, which has publicly sparred with online critics throughout the last year.
