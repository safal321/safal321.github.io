I like to end each year by surveying you all about your predictions for social networks and the broader consumer internet in the 12 months to come. One, it's a lot of fun. And two, a year later I get to read the predictions back and feel extremely dumb. Our collective guesses for 2020 weren't terrible, exactly â€” we nailed Libra (er, Diem) failing to launch, the rise of Discord, the splinternet accelerating, and a total stalemate on Section 230 reform.
