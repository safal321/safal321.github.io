Microsoft is finally releasing x64 emulation on Windows for ARM to testers today, after announcing that the feature was coming back in September. The feature, available to Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel, will allow users to run 64-bit apps that haven't yet been compiled for their ARM-powered devices. This means that if you just got one of the new Surface Pro Xs (and are willing to jump through some hoops and install a Windows update long before it's ready for public release), Microsoft says you should be able to play games like Rocket League, or run productivity apps like AutoDesk's Sketchbook.
