HP's 2020 Pavilion x360 isn't as powerful or good-looking as its Envy x360. That sounds like huge dings against the Pavilion, but as HP's bottom rung 2-in-1 machine, that's exactly what it's designed to be. And while it doesn't have the same kind of appeal or nearly as much get-up, the particular model that I reviewed has LTE support, a feature that's rarely seen at this price point.
