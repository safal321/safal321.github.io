Back in March, 9to5Google reported that Google's next streaming device will run Android TV and thus offer a more traditional user experience that's closer in line with Roku and Amazon Fire TV than the company's previous Chromecast efforts. Now, Protocol is corroborating that news and saying that the new device will “likely” be branded as a Google Nest product to help differentiate it from what came before. It'll also feature a “new user interface” that focuses on individual shows and content instead of the apps that offer them. In some sense, Android TV already does this.
