If you're shopping for a gaming laptop, you'll find good specs like Intel's powerful 10th Gen six-core i7 H-series processor, a fast PCIe-based SSD, and a 120Hz refresh rate display in many of the costly, high-end models currently available. But you'll also find all of that in Lenovo's new IdeaPad Gaming 3, a machine that costs a bit less than $1,000 even at its most expensive configuration.
