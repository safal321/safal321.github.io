OnePlus has officially announced the Nord, its first serious attempt at a midrange handset since 2015's ill-fated OnePlus X. Yet, despite the fact that it starts at just xc2xa3379 (around $480), the phone shares a lot of the DNA of the $699 OnePlus 8 released just a few short months ago, which, along with the OnePlus 8 Pro, was the company's flagship handset for this year.
