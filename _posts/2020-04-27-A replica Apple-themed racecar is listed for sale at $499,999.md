If you really want an Apple car and have half a million bucks to spend, there's a replica of a 1979 Porsche 935 K3 Apple-themed racecar up for sale, according to Apple Insider. Apple sponsored the original car during the 1980 racing season. Along with the “Apple Computer” name, the car also bears the retro rainbow logo and a sticker on its rear bumper that reads “Don't upset the Apple Car.”
