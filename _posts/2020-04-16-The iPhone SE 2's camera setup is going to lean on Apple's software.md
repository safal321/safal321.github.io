Apple's newly announced second-generation iPhone SE (or iPhone SE 2 as we'll be calling it) is the company's first phone with a single rear camera since 2018's iPhone XR. While its camera hardware is basic, the new $399 device is powered by last year's A13 Bionic chip, so it will benefit from Apple's more recent work on image processing. It's a combination that could reveal how much of Apple's photography strengths lie in hardware and how many lie in software.
