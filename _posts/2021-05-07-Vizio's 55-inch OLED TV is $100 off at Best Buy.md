Vizio's 55-inch OLED TV has received a price cut during Best Buy's sale event that will last through the weekend. Normally $1,300, it's $1,200, making it one of the most affordable methods of getting an OLED. This model made its way into our roundup of the best TVs for gaming, thanks to its HDMI 2.1 ports that allow for 4K resolution at 120Hz. In other words, it can show up to 120 frames per second.
