As The Verge's resident live-streaming reporter, I do a lot of streaming on my own time, both because it's fun and because I want to know a little about what it's like for the people I cover. That's meant I've gained a healthy appreciation for the various pieces of gear that make streaming possible â€” because streaming is the opposite of effortless. Things break constantly, and most of the time for no obvious reason. (There but for the grace of god go we, etc.) All of that said, I've found that upgrading my stream setup is one of the few true pleasures I have left; there's nothing quite as satisfying as adding a new camera or microphone or chat command that might elevate a viewer's experience.
