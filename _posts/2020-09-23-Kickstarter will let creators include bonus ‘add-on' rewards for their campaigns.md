Kickstarter is making it easier for creators to give their backers more perks when supporting a campaign. The company is launching “add-ons” today, or a la carte additional rewards that creators can offer on top of their standard backer rewards. For now, the feature is only available to select creators, although people can apply for early access by clicking the “offer add-ons” button when making their campaign. Kickstarter says it'll expand the feature in the future and will take these applications into account.
