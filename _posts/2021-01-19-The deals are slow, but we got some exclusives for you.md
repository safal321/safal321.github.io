Welcome to the weekend. If I'm being honest, this week's assortment of deals was just as spotty as last week's. So, to make it a little better, we've worked with some retailers to give Verge readers some exclusive deals. Looking forward, if you're on the hunt for, say, a big 4K TV or a home theater system, we'll be sure to include the top deals in our regular Verge Deals coverage as the Super Bowl nears.
