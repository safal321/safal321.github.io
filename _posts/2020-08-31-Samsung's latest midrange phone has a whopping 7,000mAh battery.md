Samsung has opened up preorders for the Galaxy M51 in Germany, officially confirming that its latest midrange phone has an absolutely massive 7,000mAh battery. It costs xe2x82xac360.01 (about $429), and Samsung's site says that it expects the phone to start shipping on September 11th. There's no sign of preorder pages on Samsung's other regional stores just yet, but a release in India seems likely given that Samsung teased the phone there last week.
