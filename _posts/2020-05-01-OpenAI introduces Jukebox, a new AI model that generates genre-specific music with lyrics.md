Artificial intelligence research laboratory OpenAI today debuted a new generative model that's able to make music called Jukebox. It's technologically impressive, even if the results sound like mushy versions of songs that might feel familiar. According to the post on OpenAI's blog, the researchers chose to work on music because it's hard. And even if they're not exactly what I'd call music, the results the researchers got were impressive; there are recognizable chords and melodies and words (sometimes).
