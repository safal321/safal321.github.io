Now that we're past the winter holidays, deals are a little slower than usual. Still, we found a few promos worth telling you about today. One is on Hisense's 85-inch 4K LED TV (model 85H6510G) at Best Buy. Normally $1,700, it's just $1,000. This television's sheer size is what makes this a good deal, especially if you want a big screen to watch the upcoming Super Bowl on.
