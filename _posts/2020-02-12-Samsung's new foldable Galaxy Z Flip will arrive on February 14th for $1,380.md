Samsung is unveiling its latest foldable Galaxy Z Flip phone today. It looks a lot different than the troubled Galaxy Fold, and it folds up much like the new Motorola Razr. It's clearly designed to be a full phone with a 6.7-inch OLED display that folds and shrinks into a much smaller square when it's closed. Samsung is planning to launch the Galaxy Z Flip on February 14th, priced at $1,380.
