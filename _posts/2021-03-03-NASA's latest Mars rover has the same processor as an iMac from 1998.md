NASA's brand-new Perseverance rover is the most advanced machine that's ever landed on Mars. But when it comes to rovers, “state of the art” is a subjective term. Perseverance is running on none other than a PowerPC 750, a single-core, 233MHz processor with just 6 million transistors that's most famous for powering the original “Bondi blue” iMac from 1998. It's the same type of processor that NASA already uses in its Curiosity rover.
