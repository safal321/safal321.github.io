If you've ever wanted to send text messages with weird punctuation like someone who is new to thumb-typing, Google has apparently updated its voice-to-text settings to do it for you, Android Police reports. Google's voice typing used to only add punctuation when the speaker asked for it specifically (by saying “comma” or “period,” etc.), but after an update last month, the app is now adding punctuation automatically. And judging by the 400-plus comments on a support forum post, it's not working well.
