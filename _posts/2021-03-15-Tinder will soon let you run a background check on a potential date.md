Tinder and other Match Group-owned apps are going to let their users run background checks on possible dates. The company announced an investment in Garbo, a nonprofit that looks to allow people to run background checks with only their first name and phone number or full name. The investment, of which Match didn't disclose the amount, will help make the group's tech available to Match's users, starting with the company's most popular app: Tinder.
