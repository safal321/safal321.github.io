If you haven't yet trudged through the gripping and frequently disturbing tale that The Last of Us Part II has to tell, you can get a deal on the PS4 game at Walmart right now. Normally fully-priced at $60, it's $40. As far as price cuts on PS4 exclusives go, this is a fantastic deal given the game came out just a few months ago following several delays.
