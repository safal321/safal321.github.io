I usually prefer to highlight the best deals you can get on new tech, but sometimes a refurbished deal is good enough to make the grade. Sony's 1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones haven't slipped below $278 new (down from their usual $349 price), but a well-rated eBay seller is offering them in “like-new” condition with all original accessories included for $208. And with eBay's offer code PICKCR5 used at checkout, you can knock an extra 5 percent off, totaling $198 before tax.
