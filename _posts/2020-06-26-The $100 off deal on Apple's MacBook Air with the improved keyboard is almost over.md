The deals are a little slower today than we've seen so far this week, but there are still a few that we want to tell you about. In case you missed out, Best Buy's $100 off sale on the latest MacBook Air laptop ends later today. Instead of paying $1,000 for the base model with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and a 10th Gen Intel Core i3 processor, you can get it for $900. It's available in silver, gold, or space gray, and unlike the maligned butterfly key switches used in the previous generation, this keyboard is far better.
