Tomb Raider: 10th Anniversary, a remake of the original Tomb Raider game for Sony's PSP that was canceled in 2006, has recently resurfaced as a playable alpha, according to PC Gamer. The game was being developed by Core Design before it was shuttered in favor of Crystal Dynamics' cross-platform Tomb Raider: Anniversary and Tomb Raider: Legend, a reimagining of the origin story of treasure-hunter Lara Croft.
