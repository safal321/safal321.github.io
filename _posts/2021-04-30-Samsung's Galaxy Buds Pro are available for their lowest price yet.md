The excellent $250 deal on the Apple Watch Series 6 has completely sold out, unfortunately, but there are some other stellar sales happening. Woot is having a one-day sale on the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds, the company's latest, most feature-packed model. These keep dropping in price, though this deal is the best yet by a wide margin. If you use the Woot mobile app (iOS, Android) to buy them and have Amazon Prime, you'll get 10 percent off the order. So, instead of paying $170 (which matches the lowest price we'd seen up to this point), you'll pay just $153 before tax.
