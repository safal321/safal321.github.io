The Roku Channel is getting its first batch of Quibi shows on May 20th, Roku has announced. There'll be 30 so-called “Roku Originals” available to stream initially, but Roku says it eventually plans to release all 75 of Quibi's titles on its service. They'll be available to watch free of charge in the US, Canada, and UK, with ads inserted in between individual short-form episodes. Roku announced in January that it would be exclusively licensing Quibi's library.
