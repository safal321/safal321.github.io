Fossil is making a smartwatch with LTE for the first time, the Gen 5 LTE. As you might guess from the relatively boring name, the watch is based on Fossil's Gen 5 Wear OS platform. That means that it has many of the same features and likely performs in the same way as Fossil's smartwatches have since late 2019, when we first reviewed the Gen 5 platform. It will retail for $349 and be available this spring in the US either in Fossil stores or at Verizon.
