Verizon will sell the OnePlus 8 for $799 starting April 29th, marking the first time that the carrier has directly offered a OnePlus device. Phones from OnePlus have supported Verizon's network dating back to the OnePlus 6T, and Verizon certified them for “bring your own device” use by allowing customers to pop a SIM card in and get going. But now, OnePlus will get the full backing of Verizon's retail presence — online, through the My Verizon app, and presumably and in stores once we're all able to visit those again. Verizon says this launch is the start of “a new relationship” between the companies.
