In September, Logitech will ship a colorful collection of gaming accessories, consisting of a few preexisting products with some fresh tints, and one brand-new product: the $129 G733 Lightspeed gaming headset. With the exception of the $229 G915 TKL wireless mechanical keyboard, which is now offered in white instead of only black, other accessories — the $39 G203 Lightsync wired mouse, the $59 G305 Lightspeed wireless mouse, and the G733 headset — will come in four colors: blue, lilac purple, white, and black.
