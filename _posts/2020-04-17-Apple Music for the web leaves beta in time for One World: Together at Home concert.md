Apple Music's web interface has left beta, MacRumors reports. Heading to beta.music.apple.com now redirects to music.apple.com, where you'll see an interface that's similar to the Music app on Macs. The launch comes a little over six months after the web interface launched in beta, and days before Apple Music will be one of the online streaming providers of the Lady Gaga-curated One World: Together at Home concert.
