Apple is making watchOS 7 available via public beta starting today. It's the first time that Apple has released a public beta for its smartwatches that you can try out before the final release. It joins a couple other operating systems that Apple currently has in public preview, including iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS Big Sur.
