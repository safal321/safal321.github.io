Apple announced the successor to its beloved iPhone SE: the iPhone SE 2. The specs are a mix of what you'll find in the iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone XR, and the iPhone 8. It has the latest A13 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, an overall design that mimics the iPhone 8 (it should even work with most iPhone 8 cases), and a few camera traits that seem to be similar to what Apple's camera array in the iPhone XR could handle. This phone is smaller than other iPhones that are currently available, and it's far cheaper at just $399 to start.
