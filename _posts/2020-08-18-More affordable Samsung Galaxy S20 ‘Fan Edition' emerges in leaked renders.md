Samsung's unannounced Galaxy S20 “Fan Edition” (FE) has leaked again in new renders from Evan Blass. A series of leaks over the past few months from the likes of SamMobile, Ice Universe, and The Elec suggest the phone will be a cheaper alternative to Samsung's Galaxy S20, similar to the Galaxy S10 Lite that it announced earlier this year. The latest renders, which can be viewed over on XDA Developers, show the Galaxy S20 FE in six colors: blue, mint green, white, red, pink, and orange.
