Realme has announced the GT 5G, built with Qualcomm's top-tier Snapdragon 888 chipset. It comes with plenty of other flagship-esque specs, too, like a 120Hz screen, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast charger included. What it doesn't have is a flagship-like price; it's on sale in China for 2,799 yuan currently, or about $430.
