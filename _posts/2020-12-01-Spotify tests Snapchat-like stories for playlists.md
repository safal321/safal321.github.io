Spotify is testing a new Snapchat-style Stories feature alongside some of its playlists. On its Christmas Hits playlist, for example, a series of artists including Jennifer Lopez, Kelly Clarkson, and Pentatonix use a series of short video clips to share personal anecdotes about the festive period and their songwriting processes. Engadget notes that similar stories have been spotted on the Tear Drop emo rap playlist, and a version of Megan Thee Stallion's album Good News.
