Amazon's Fire TV Cube can now be linked with a webcam for video chats on your TV screen. The new feature is available starting today and is limited to the newer second-generation model of the Cube. But it allows owners of that product to start two-way video calls with “any Alexa-enabled device with a screen, including tablets, phones and devices like the Echo Show.” A new software update that enables video calling will begin rolling out today through the coming weeks in the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain.
