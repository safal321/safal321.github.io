As promised, K/DA — the virtual K-pop group that's part of the ever-expanding League of Legends universe — has its very first album on the way. Today, developer Riot revealed that the band's first EP, titled All/Out, will be out on November 6th. K/DA released its first single following a two-year hiatus back in August.
