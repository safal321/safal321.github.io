The first project from Final Fantasy XV director Hajime Tabata's new studio JP Games will finally be released next month, the company has announced. The Pegasus Dream Tour is a mobile RPG themed around the Paralympic Games, and it's the first video game ever to carry the official Paralympics license. It was initially announced more than two years ago, but the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there'd been radio silence on the project ever since.
