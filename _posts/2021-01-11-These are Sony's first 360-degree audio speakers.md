Earlier today, Sony announced that it would be releasing two new speakers compatible with 360 Reality Audio, its spatial audio technology that replicates the feel of live music by placing different sounds and vocals in a virtual sphere around you. It said its plan is to release them this spring, but it didn't share what the speakers would look like. We didn't have to wait to learn more about them, though, as Sony's UK website now has full product pages for the upcoming SRS-RA5000 and SRS-RA3000 speakers.
