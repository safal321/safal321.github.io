The Genki Covert Dock doesn't look like a dock. It looks more like a wall brick that replicates the functionality of Nintendo's much larger Switch Dock, but it's small enough to stick into a pocket. It's a great Switch accessory to have if you travel a lot and want to connect your console to a TV wherever you go.
