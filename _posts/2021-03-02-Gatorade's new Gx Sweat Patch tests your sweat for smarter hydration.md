Gatorade is today releasing a new fitness wearable that tests your sweat to let you know how and when to best rehydrate after working out. The Gx Sweat Patch is sold in packages of two for $25 and pairs with Gatorade's Gx app to let you efficiently hydrate and hopefully recover faster and avoid cramps in the process.
