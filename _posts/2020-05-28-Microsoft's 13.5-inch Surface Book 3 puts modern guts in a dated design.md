I've been a 13.5-inch Surface Book 2 owner since 2018. I love the thing because it has a combination of unique advantages, such as its 3:2 aspect ratio, discrete GPU options, and unique detachable screen, that you won't find in any other laptop on the market. But those features brought with them a number of small (but glaring) flaws: a large and wobbly hinge, a limited port selection, and very visible bezels. If Microsoft fixed those, I thought the new Surface Book 3 could be a nearly perfect device.
