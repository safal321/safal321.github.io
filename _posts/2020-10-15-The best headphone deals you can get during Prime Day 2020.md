Amazon Prime Day 2020 has brought several good deals on headphones of all kinds, including Sony's new WH-1000XM4 wireless over-ear model that has some of the best noise cancellation on the market. That particular set of headphones usually costs $350 and hasn't seen as big of a price drop as it has today at Amazon. If you have a Prime membership, you can pick up a set for $298, and it will come with a $25 Amazon gift card with purchase. Best Buy is offering the same price, and you'll get a gift card to that store with the purchase.
