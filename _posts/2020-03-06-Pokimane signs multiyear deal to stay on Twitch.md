As other notable streamers continue to leave Twitch for other platforms, one of the service's biggest stars is staying put: today, Imane “Pokimane” Anys announced that she has signed a “multi-year deal” to remain on the platform. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Anys is Twitch's biggest female star, with more than 3.9 million followers, and she's long been a mainstay, having started streaming way back in 2013. She even has her own Fortnite emote.
