Razor, the company that helped kick off the scooter craze nearly two decades ago, has just unveiled a new lineup of affordable electric scooters for adults. The California-based company is introducing three new models: the EcoSmart SUP, E300 HD, and the C25. Along with the recently released E Prime III, Razor is hoping to expand its footprint in the adult scooter space, while also retaining its title as a trustworthy and recognizable brand in an overly saturated market.
