There are many reasons you might want a projector over a TV: you may want a bigger image than a TV can offer, or you don't like the look of a TV in your living room, or you want to have casual movie nights with your friends or family. Since movie theaters aren't an option for most people right now, a lot of friends have been asking me what projector to get for their living room. So to give them the best answer, I tested nine different projectors in my apartment. After three months and way too many movies, I've found the projector best suited for most situations.
