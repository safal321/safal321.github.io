Now is a good time to get some Nintendo Switch games, whether you have the console or are hoping to get one soon. Best Buy and Amazon have knocked off as much as $25 off some fantastic titles that are easy to recommend, including Fire Emblem: Three Houses (my personal favorite from 2019), Splatoon 2, Mario Tennis Aces, and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. Games that don't usually see a discount are $20 off, like The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Luigi's Mansion 3.
