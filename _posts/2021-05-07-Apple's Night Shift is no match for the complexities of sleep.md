Apple's Night Shift feature, which it says “may help you get a better night's sleep,” doesn't appear to live up to its claim, according to new research. Because exposure to blue light affects the regulation of sleep cycles, the hope is that Night Shift, which filters blue light from screens after sunset, will make falling asleep easier. But as a recent study shows, sleep is weird and complicated, and a single phone feature likely won't do much to combat sleepless nights.
