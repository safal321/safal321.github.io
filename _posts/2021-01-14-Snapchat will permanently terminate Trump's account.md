Snapchat will permanently terminate President Trump's account, Snap announced on Wednesday. Snap had indefinitely suspended Trump's account last week after he incited a pro-Trump mob to attack the US Capitol, and it has now made the decision to make that suspension permanent. The news was first reported by Axios.
