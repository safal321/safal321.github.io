Tesla has officially started delivering the first Model Ys to customers in the US ahead of its original schedule, and despite the world becoming increasingly wrapped up in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic. The company tweeted a video Monday showing the small electric SUV going through the production process and being tested in different parts of the world, along with a link to the order page. A few of the first deliveries were also spotted over the weekend by some Tesla-focused YouTubers like Teslanomics' Ben Sullins.
