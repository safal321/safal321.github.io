The second and final day of Prime Day 2020 is here, but there are still a ton of deals to take advantage of for the next several hours, including this fantastic deal on Sony's new WH-1000XM4 wireless over-ear headphones. Normally, these headphones cost $350, but you can buy a pair for just $298. Even better? Both Amazon and Best Buy will give you a $25 gift card to its website when you purchase these headphones. B&H Photo is also price matching the headphones, but unfortunately it does not include the gift card sweetener like Amazon and Best Buy. The price is available for both color options (black and silver); its also available in midnight blue, but its an exclusive color available only at Best Buy.
