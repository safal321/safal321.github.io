Today Oppo is announcing the Find X2 Pro, its first phone to use the Find name since the original Find X in 2018. Unlike that phone, it doesn't use the still-unique motorized sliding mechanism that helped Oppo achieve a notchless display. But like that phone, it does see Oppo turning out the sleekest, fastest, most premium device it possibly can in order to compete with the highest-end models from the likes of Samsung and Huawei.
