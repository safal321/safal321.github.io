Wyze, best known for its inexpensive cameras and smart home gadgets (and an unfortunate server breach last year), is planning several new products for 2020, including the Wyze Band. Part fitness tracker, part smart home controller, the Wyze Band will have built-in Alexa capabilities, according to a blog post from the company. Dave Zatz gave some deeper insights on ZatzNotFunny with details gleaned from a Federal Communications Commission filing and a publicly available beta app (via Engadget).
