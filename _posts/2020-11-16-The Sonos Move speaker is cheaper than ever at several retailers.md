The Sonos Move smart speaker is $100 off at retailers like Best Buy, B&H Photo and Amazon today only, bringing the cost from $400 to a more reasonable $300. You can save a little more at Wellbots on the speaker if you live outside of NY, as it doesn't charge sales tax on purchases for all other US states.
