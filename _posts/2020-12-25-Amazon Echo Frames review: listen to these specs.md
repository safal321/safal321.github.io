I did not expect to like the Amazon Echo Frames as much as I do. The concept is relatively simple: they're a pair of eyeglasses with tiny little speakers and microphones embedded in the stems so you can listen to music and command Alexa. They run $249 and come with basic plastic lenses, but you can take them to an optometrist and get prescription lenses.
