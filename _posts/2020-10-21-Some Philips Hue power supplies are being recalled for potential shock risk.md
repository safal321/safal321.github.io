Signify, the company behind Philips Hue, is recalling power supplies that shipped with six outdoor lights due to concerns that they could shock owners. The power supplies may short-circuit due to water leakage “in very rare cases,” the company said, potentially hurting someone who were to touch the unit while it was still wet.
