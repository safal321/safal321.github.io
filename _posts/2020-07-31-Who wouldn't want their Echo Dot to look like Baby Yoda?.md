There are plenty of things I could tell you about Otterbox's new stand for the third-generation Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker. I could tell you about its “durable materials” or how it's designed to “securely” hold on to your Echo device. The Amazon listing even claims its “precision-fit, non-slip base” is “engineered for optimal audio output.”
