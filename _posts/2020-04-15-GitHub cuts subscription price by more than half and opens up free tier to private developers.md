GitHub, the Microsoft-owned software hosting site, said on Tuesday it will reduce prices on one of its most popular paid tiers and also moving a key feature of all its paid plans into its existing free tier. Now, GitHub says the “Teams” subscription, which previously cost $9 per user a month, will now be $4 per user a month. All existing paid customers on the plan will move to the new pricing model starting today.
