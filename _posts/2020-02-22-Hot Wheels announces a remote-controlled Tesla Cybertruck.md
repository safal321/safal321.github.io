Mattel has announced a Hot Wheels-branded remote-controlled version of Tesla's Cybertruck. It is available to preorder now and will come in two sizes: there's a 1:64 scale RC Cybertruck that costs $20 and a much bigger 1:10 scale version that runs for $400. Both are expected to ship in December 2020, but they're limited editions and will only be available until they're sold out, Mattel says.
