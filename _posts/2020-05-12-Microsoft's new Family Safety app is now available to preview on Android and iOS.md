Microsoft is launching a dedicated new app, Family Safety, designed for managing kids' screentime and app usage. The app is available now in preview form on both Android and iOS, the company announced in a blog post on Monday. To access it, you have to fill out a form here and specify how many family members you intend to have on the same preview account. The app was first announced at the end of March as an extension of the company's existing family group features for Windows and Xbox.
