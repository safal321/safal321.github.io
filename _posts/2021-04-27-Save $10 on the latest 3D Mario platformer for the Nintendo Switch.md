At Amazon and Walmart, you can score a $10 discount on Super Mario 3D World for the Nintendo Switch. This discount brings the cost of the Wii U remake, which includes the new Bowser's Fury open-world expansion, down to $50. Sales on this title have been rare, since it came out recently. If you've done everything in Super Mario Odyssey and are looking for some more 3D-style Mario platforming, this one is worth picking up. Just so you know, this is for the cartridge version.
