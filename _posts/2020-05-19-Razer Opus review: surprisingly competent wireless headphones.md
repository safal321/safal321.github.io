Razer's new $200 Opus noise-canceling, wireless headphones aren't good enough to tempt me away from my tried-and-true $350 Sony WH-1000XM3. I'm not surprised by that, partially given the huge price difference. More so, I wasn't expecting miracles given Razer's comparative lack of experience in making headphones. However, they are good enough to make me doubt if my Sony's are that much better to warrant costing almost double the amount. My answer to that question is yes, but nevertheless, that the Opus is making me question it at all speaks to their quality and value.
