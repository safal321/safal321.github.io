Apple and Google are still struggling to come close to Amazon's enormous share of the home smart speaker market, and that trend will continue through 2021, a new eMarketer report predicts. Some 70 percent of US smart speaker users will use an Amazon Echo in 2020, close to last year's 72.9 percent. By next year, that number may drop slightly to about 68.2 percent, according to the report. So Amazon's lead is slowly falling, but it still holds a dominant position.
