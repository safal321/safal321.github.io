Nintendo's online service is experiencing outages, the company confirmed today. We've verified that the Nintendo eShop appears to be down for Switch users in both the US and UK, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's online functionality was failing to load in the UK. Nintendo's network status page noted that the outage was ongoing as of 1:56am PT, but did not give any detail on when service might be restored.
