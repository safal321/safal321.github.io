You might be wondering: “Did Amazon just break Apple's App Store guidelines by bringing a cloud gaming service to iPhone?” And I can understand why, given that I told you just last week how Apple doesn't permit Google Stadia in anything close to its current form, and Amazon's just-announced Luna is a lot like Stadia. Wouldn't the same rules apply?
