One of the biggest names in streaming is heading to YouTube. Today, Tyler “Ninja” Blevins started streaming on Google's platform, finding a new home after the surprise closure of Microsoft's Mixer. Ninja teased the announcement earlier today in a tweet, and started his new YouTube venture with a Fortnite stream alongside Dr Lupo, TimTheTatman, and Courage. It's not clear yet whether this is an exclusive deal, or if Ninja will feature on other platforms, like Twitch, as well.
