Sony's WH-1000XM3 over-ear wireless headphones normally cost $350, but they're down to $248, which is the cheapest that we've seen them at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. Other sites have sold refurbished models for around $200, but this is a great deal for a new set. These are now Sony's previous-generation flagship noise-canceling headphones, making way just last week for the WH-1000XM4 to take their place as the model for all other brands to beat.
