Google Assistant is now available on Samsung's 2020 TVs in the UK, France, Germany, and Italy, and will be available in 12 countries by the end of the year, Samsung has announced. This follows the launch of Google's voice assistant on Samsung's TVs in the US last month. Samsung says it'll roll out in Spain, Brazil, India and South Korea by late November. The voice assistant is available alongside Amazon's Alexa and Samsung's own Bixby voice assistants.
