Etsy is giving iOS users the ability to see what art will look like on their wall before they buy it. People can pull up any painting, photograph, or print that's available on Etsy and project it wherever they want through augmented reality. If an item is available in different sizes, those can be selected and previewed, too. This works on both iPhone and iPad, and the company says it hopes to make the feature available to Android users “as soon as possible.”
