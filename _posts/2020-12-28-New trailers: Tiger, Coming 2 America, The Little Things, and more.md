So I watched Wonder Woman 1984, and I may need to watch it a second time before I decide what I think, because right now I think it's sort of a parody of 1980s movies that doesn't quite hit the mark despite a fine performance by Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian!) as the villain. Also about to wrap season 7 in my binge-watch of Homeland... I've stuck with it this long, so need to find out how it all ends. Note to self though: pick something a little less dystopian for the next binge-watching project.
