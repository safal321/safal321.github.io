Twitter has tweaked its UI to make it easier to add new tweets to old threads. (No, it's not an “edit tweet” feature.) As you're composing a new tweet, you'll be able to pull down a view of your past tweets and threads into the composition window. Previously, you'd have to go back and find the thread, then add the new tweet at the end.
