Whether you're heading to Tokyo for two weeks or simply doing a few days in Montreal, a crossbody bag is a very practical thing to pack for a trip. Unlike a slippery tote, a crossbody will stay on your shoulder while you remove your shoes and simultaneously scramble for your boarding pass at security. And once you reach your destination, a crossbody feels like a slightly more secure way to carry around important items, like, say, your passport. While the words “crossbody travel bag” might bring to mind a stodgy nylon number with a few too many zippers, that doesn't have to be the case. We talked to nine travel editors, trip planners, and a documentary photographer to hear about their go-to bags, including an ultra-secure, gorpcore-esque nylon version with plenty of interior pockets, and a structured cylindrical leather option elegant enough to carry from a day spent touring to a nice dinner. Read on for bags that don't scream tourist, and that you might even consider using once you get home.
