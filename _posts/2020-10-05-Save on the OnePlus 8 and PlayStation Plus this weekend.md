Welcome to the weekend. Amazon Prime Day 2020 kicks off in less than two weeks, starting on Tuesday, October 13th and lasting through the 14th. That's two days to get some of the best deals that we'll see all year. We're prepping behind the scenes for the event to make sure you're able to get exactly what you're looking for. But for now, I'm going to highlight a few of this week's best deals that are still going on.
