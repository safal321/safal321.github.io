Sony's PlayStation 5 will launch on November 12th in the US starting at $399.99. That price will get you the digital edition of the console that doesn't have a Blu-ray disc drive. If you want a disc drive for playing disc-based PS5 games, 4K Blu-ray movies, and PS4 games that may end up being compatible, there's a larger version of the console that has that for $499.
