If you're looking for a gaming rig that's a step above the budget price point but still more affordable than the flashiest PCs on the market, you're looking for MSI's Leopard line. With a starting price of $1,599 ($1,899 as tested), the 2021 GP66 Leopard takes the same top-end chips that are in the likes of MSI's GE66 Raider and the Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 and puts them in a less exciting, more affordable chassis. In this case, that's Intel's eight-core Core i7-10870H and Nvidia's brand-spanking-new RTX 3070 mobile graphics card â€” components you'll also see in luxury gaming flagships across the board.
