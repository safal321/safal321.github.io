If you've never gotten around to buying and playing Metro: Last Light, the remastered version is free on the GOG store today and tomorrow (via Polygon). The game has been out for a while now, but it's still as terrifying as ever, even if you're playing it for a second or third time. And, when you get a game from GOG, it comes without any DRM, so your copy of the game isn't tied to any particular platform. You can download the files to your hard drive, and it'll still run without GOG's launcher installed.
