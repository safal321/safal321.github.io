When the enhanced remake of the Mass Effect trilogy arrives, it won't include multiplayer. According to longtime Mass Effect developer Mac Walters, the team would have had to put in an immense amount of effort to bring the feature to the Legendary Edition. “At some point we had to draw a line,” the project director said in a briefing about the game. “We've talked about doing the remaster for some time now, and at least at one point in time everything was on the table.”
