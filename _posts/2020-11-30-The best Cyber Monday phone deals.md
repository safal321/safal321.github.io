Cyber Monday is a good time of the year to consider upgrading your phone. Whether you're looking for a deal through a carrier or you'd rather get an unlocked phone, you can save during the holiday season. The best deals on phones are on Android devices, including newer models from Google, Samsung, OnePlus, and more. Predictably, these big price cuts don't apply to iPhones. Nothing new there, but there is a gift card promo happening if you are interested in picking one up.
