Amazon has unveiled a heap of Black Friday deals to give you an early start on your holiday shopping. While we expect many more deals across all categories of tech for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, these ones are focused on Amazon-made devices. This is especially good news since there are a bunch of new products seeing their first price cuts, including Amazon's ball-shaped Echo speakers and Eero's fastest mesh Wi-Fi routers. Plus, there are some solid deals on Fire TV streaming devices.
