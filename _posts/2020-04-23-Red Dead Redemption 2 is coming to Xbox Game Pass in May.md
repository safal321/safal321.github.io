Microsoft is bringing Red Dead Redemption 2 to its Xbox Game Pass subscription for Xbox One consoles. It's a big addition that will see subscribers gain access to the action-adventure game on May 7th. While Red Dead Redemption 2 is arriving on Xbox Game Pass, Grand Theft Auto V will be disappearing at the same time, so fans have until May 7th to play Rockstar Games' other hugely popular game.
