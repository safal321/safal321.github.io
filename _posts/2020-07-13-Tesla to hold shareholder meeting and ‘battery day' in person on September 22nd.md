Tesla has finally settled on a date for its delayed annual shareholder meeting and “battery day” for investors: September 22nd. The meeting will be held in person at the company's vehicle factory in Fremont, California, though it will presumably also be live-streamed. Only people who are shareholders of the company's stock can attend.
