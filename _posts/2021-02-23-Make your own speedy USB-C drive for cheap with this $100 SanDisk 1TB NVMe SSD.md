There's a wide variety of deals happening in the tech space, including TVs, computer components, and more. Starting with a gadget that'll give you some fast transfer speeds, SanDisk's Ultra 1TB NVMe SSD is $100 at Best Buy. That's a great price for this kind of capacity, given it's much faster than your standard SATA SSD. SanDisk covers this model with a five-year warranty. In terms of how you can use it, make sure your PC's motherboard has an open M.2 2280 slot, or get crafty and buy an M.2 enclosure to turn it into a fast, compact external drive like the one shown above.
