T-Mobile is offering a new, low-stakes way to try out its network for free for 30 days with no additional equipment required. Identified by Light Reading, T-Mobile's existing Test Drive program now works over eSIM with compatible iPhones. All you need to do is download an app, follow the instructions to start the trial with eSIM, and you're up and running â€” no billing information required. There's no change to your current carrier plan or phone number, but you'll be using T-Mobile data on your device.
