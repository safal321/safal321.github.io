Last Thursday, Amazon opened its 11th Amazon Fresh grocery store, Bloomberg reports. It's a remarkably quick expansion of the initiative considering Amazon only opened its first store of this type on an invite-only basis in August in Los Angeles. The company doesn't appear to be slowing down anytime soon either, with Bloomberg reporting that it has plans for at least 28 more locations (though Amazon was only willing to confirm five of these).
