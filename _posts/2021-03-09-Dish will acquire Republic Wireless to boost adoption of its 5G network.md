Satellite television provider Dish Network has announced its plan to acquire cell carrier Republic Wireless, Dish said on Monday. The acquisition, when it closes, will give Dish roughly 200,000 wireless customers to help boost its 5G network, which Dish plans to launch later this year. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Dish says Republic Wireless customers won't see any immediate changes to their plans and won't have to take any action on their accounts.
