B&H Photo is offering the best price we've seen on the OnePlus 8 in the onyx black colorway. Originally $800, it's just $450 for the unlocked Verizon variant, which is the only version that supports UWB 5G and sub-6GHz 5G when connected to Verizon's network. Alternatively, it works with AT&T and T-Mobile's networks if you're with either of those. This model originally sold for more than the base OnePlus 8 because of its Verizon 5G compatibility, but at this point, B&H's deal knocks its price down below that of the base.
