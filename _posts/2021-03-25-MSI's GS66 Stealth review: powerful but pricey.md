I had hoped that MSI's GS66 Stealth for 2021 would look and feel a little different than last year's model â€” not that the 2020 version was particularly busted in any major way. In fact, the previous model was a few nips and tucks shy of reaching Razer's high bar for gaming laptop design. But while the outside shell of this year's model is exactly the same as last year's, I can live with that because what's inside is mostly all-new.
