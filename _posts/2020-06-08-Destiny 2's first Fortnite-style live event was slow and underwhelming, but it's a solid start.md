Destiny 2's first ever Fortnite-style live event just wrapped earlier today, and it was unfortunately not quite what some players were expecting. Instead of something monumental and game-changing for a key part of the game world, it was more of a slow burn alternative to a standard video game cutscene. And instead of delivering a strong narrative pay off on a season's worth of otherwise dull and repetitive activity, the Almighty event ended without any meaningful change in direction or surprising new development.
