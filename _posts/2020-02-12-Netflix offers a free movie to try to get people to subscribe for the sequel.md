Netflix thinks its original content can get people to subscribe, so through March 9th, the streaming service is giving US residents a free movie, To All the Boys I've Loved Before, in the hopes that it might get them to pay and sign up to watch the sequel, which came out today. Netflix has previously tested this strategy in the UK with The Crown and for regional shows in India, Mexico, and Colombia. This is the first time it's offering a free movie in the US.
