Peloton is fighting to have the terms “spin” and “spinning” treated as generic terms, arguing that they've entered into common usage in spite of being trademarked since the late 90s, Bloomberg reports. This week it filed petitions with the US Patent and Trademark Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to try and cancel both trademarks owned by Mad Dogg Athletics, arguing that “spin class and spin bike are part of the fitness lexicon” and that they're “generic terms to describe a type of exercise bike and associated in-studio class.”
