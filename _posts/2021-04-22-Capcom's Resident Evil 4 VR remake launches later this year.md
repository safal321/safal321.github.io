Facebook Reality Labs has offered more detail about a virtual reality remake of Resident Evil 4, following Capcom's original announcement last week. The game will launch later this year exclusively on Facebook's Oculus Quest 2 headset, although the exact date is still a mystery. As Capcom's first trailer indicated, it's a first-person VR adaptation of the 2005 third-person game, with a focus on making weapons and movement feel more natural with Oculus Touch motion controllers.
