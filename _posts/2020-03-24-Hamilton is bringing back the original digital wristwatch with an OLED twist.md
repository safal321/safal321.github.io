Hamilton is bringing back the original digital watch with the PSR, a 50th anniversary tribute to the company's legendary Pulsar Time Computer â€” the first commercially sold digital watch, which was released to massive hype in 1972. (The watch was first announced in 1970, hence the anniversary release this year.)
