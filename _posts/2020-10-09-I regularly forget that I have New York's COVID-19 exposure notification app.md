Back in April, Apple and Google announced that they were teaming up to develop a Bluetooth Low Energy-based contact tracing system to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Last week — five months later — New York, where I live, launched an app called COVID Alert NY that uses the system. After months of following news of its development and watching the rollout of apps in other states, I was excited to have the option to use it myself. I downloaded it, tucked it in a folder on my iPhone — and promptly forgot about it.
