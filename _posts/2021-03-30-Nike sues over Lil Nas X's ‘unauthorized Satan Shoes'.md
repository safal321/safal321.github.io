Nike has sued internet collective MSCHF for selling “unauthorized Satan Shoes” in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X. The shoe company says MSCHF infringed on its trademarks by selling limited-edition custom Nikes that were allegedly modified with a drop of human blood. Since the Satan Shoes (as they are officially called) were announced last week, Nike claims they've harmed its reputation, “including among consumers who believe that Nike is endorsing satanism.” It's asking for the shoes to be destroyed and for MSCHF to pay financial damages.
