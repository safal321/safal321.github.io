Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which came out as Yakuza 7 in Japan early this year, is getting a Western release in November. While every core game in the series since Yakuza 2 had Japanese voice acting and English subtitles for its Western release, Yakuza 7 is getting a full English dub like last year's spin-off title Judgment. The cast is headed by George Takei, who plays yakuza patriarch Masumi Arakawa.
