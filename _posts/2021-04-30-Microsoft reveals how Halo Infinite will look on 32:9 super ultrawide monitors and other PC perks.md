Microsoft has something of a history of neglecting PC gaming, but it's trying to change that in a big way â€” by promising its flagship Halo Infinite will feel like a native PC game when it arrives later this year. We've known for many months that it wouldn't be the Xbox Series X's killer app, but Microsoft's trying to make PC gamers feel like first-class citizens too, with features as forward-looking as support for 32:9 super-ultrawide monitors like the Samsung Odyssey G9 I reviewed late last year.
