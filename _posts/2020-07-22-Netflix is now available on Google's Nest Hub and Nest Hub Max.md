Google's Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max smart displays have beaten Amazon in being the first to get official support for streaming Netflix content. Starting today, you can link your Netflix subscription through the Google Home or Assistant app to watch its content on your Google Nest-branded smart display. After that, you can call out to the Google Assistant to play a particular show, or just say “Hey Google, open Netflix.” You can then scroll through the interface manually via the touchscreen on either Nest Hub model.
