The Apple Watch Series 6 releases tomorrow, starting at $399 for the 40mm size and $429 for the 44mm size. If you don't think you need the latest model, you can save $100 on the now-previous version of Apple's smartwatch, the Series 5. Both Amazon and Walmart have the larger 44mm size with the gold aluminum case and pink sport band for $329.
