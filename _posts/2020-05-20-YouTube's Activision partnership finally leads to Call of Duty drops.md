The Call of Duty League (CDL) announced today that you'll soon be able to earn in-game rewards, or “drops,” for watching CDL broadcasts, and the Overwatch League appears to be teasing that drops are on the way as well. The announcement follows Activision Blizzard and YouTube's multiyear deal announced in January that made the Google-owned video platform the exclusive streaming partner for Activision's esports leagues.
