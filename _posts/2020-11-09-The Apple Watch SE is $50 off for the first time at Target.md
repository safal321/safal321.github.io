The Apple Watch SE is $50 off at Target, which drops it down to $230. This is the lowest price we've seen for this new smartwatch, which launched in September as the cheaper, step-down alternative to spending hundreds more on the Apple Watch Series 6. The SE lacks an ambient display, but it features many of the same specs as the Series 5 smartwatch, including the S5 processor, the W3 wireless chip, and 32GB of storage.
