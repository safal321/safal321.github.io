Deals from the last week or so have been especially kind to gamers who have a PS4 or PS5. Sony's Days of Play sale event has discounted many games, and today there are price cuts on subscriptions that will help you get more enjoyment out of your console. At Newegg, a one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus is $44, down from Sony's usual $60 price. It's just one dollar more at Amazon, if you'd prefer to shop there. This service will allow you to play online multiplayer games, and it'll make you eligible to download some complimentary games every month.
