Axon — the law enforcement company that makes Tasers, police body cameras, and other police and military technologies — has announced a new partnership with US drone company Skydio. Through the new deal, Axon will become the exclusive provider of Skydio's drones (like the Skydio 2 and X2) to law enforcement and police agencies, while Skydio will be able to offer Axon's drone-based software tools, like Axon Evidence and Axon Respond on its drones.
