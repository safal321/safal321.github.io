The Oculus Quest 2, Facebook's new virtual reality headset, has started shipping today. The Quest 2 is a cheaper, revamped version of the original 2019 Quest. It's got the same untethered standalone design but with a new chipset and a big bump in screen resolution and controller battery life. And it's starting at $299 for the base 64GB model and $399 for a 256GB version, a $100 drop from the original Quest.
