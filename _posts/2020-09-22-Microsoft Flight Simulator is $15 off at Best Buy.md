Microsoft's ever-popular Flight Simulator for Windows 10 PCs is $45 at Best Buy, down from its usual $60 price. It's possible to get the game for just the monthly cost of Game Pass on PC ($10 per month after an introductory $1 deal), but this deal is for people who just want to own the game without being tied down to another subscription.
