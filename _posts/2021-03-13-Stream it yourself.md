PmsProxy, a partnered Twitch streamer who has 147,000 followers, was tired. Tired of streaming Grand Theft Auto roleplay, and of streaming herself playing games more generally — something she'd been doing nearly every day for around six years. “I didn't just want to sit and play games all day, I realized,” she says when I reach her by Discord. “I want to either tell a story through roleplay or just do something that made it feel fulfilling, and roleplay wasn't that.” So she decided to make a change: instead of streaming herself playing games, she'd stream herself making things for her business.
