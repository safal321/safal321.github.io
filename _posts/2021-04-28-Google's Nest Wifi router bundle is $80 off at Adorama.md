Google's Nest Wifi bundle that includes one router and one Point (Google's name for an extender) costs $189 at Adorama, which is one of the lowest prices we've seen yet for this model. You can get this deal until Saturday, May 1st by adding the offer code EXTRAOFF80 at the checkout screen (located under the payment section). To put that price in context, the router alone usually costs $169 and the additional Point is priced normally at $149. In other words, this is like getting the Point for just $20.
