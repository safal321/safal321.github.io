In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones' upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it's getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don't have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It's harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12.
