Home security company ADT is suing Amazon subsidiary Ring, claiming its recent designs are a “brazen” copy of ADT's octagonal blue symbol. The firm cites Ring's blue octagonal outdoor siren as a recent example. In the filing, ADT lists a dozen of its trademark registrations dating back to the late 90s that feature a combination of blue and octagonal designs, and claims millions of its customers display this symbol to show that their homes use ADT's security systems.
