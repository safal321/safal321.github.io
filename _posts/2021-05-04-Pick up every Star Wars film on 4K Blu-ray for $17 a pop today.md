You probably knew already that it's May 4th, or the Star Wars-themed May the Fourth (be with you) day. Lots of retailers are discounting their Star Wars stuff, and it's led to some of today's best deals â€” that is, if you like Star Wars or are at least curious about it. Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart are offering each Star Wars film in UHD Blu-ray for $17, down from around $30. It's a good deal if you care about owning physical copies and have a device like an Xbox One S, Series X, a PS5 with a disc drive, or just a standard 4K Blu-ray player that can get the most from this kind of disc.
