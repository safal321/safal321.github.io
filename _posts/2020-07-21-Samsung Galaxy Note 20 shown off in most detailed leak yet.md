Samsung's Galaxy Note 20, the step-down model from the top-of-the-line Note 20 Ultra, has leaked in a new 360-degree render thanks to tipster Evan Blass. The render shows off a handset with a much flatter screen than what we're expecting from the Ultra, and the rear camera module also appears to lack the Ultra's fourth sensor, which is speculated to be either a 3D ToF sensor or a laser autofocus.
