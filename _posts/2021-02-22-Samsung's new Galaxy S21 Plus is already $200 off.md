Samsung released its Galaxy S21 phones in late January, and it isn't taking long for its original price to plummet. The Galaxy S21 Plus with a 6.7-inch 120Hz OLED screen and 128GB of storage that originally sold for $1,000 is now $800 at Amazon, which is the steepest price cut yet. Making this deal even better is the extra $100 in savings Amazon is offering on the Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds (knocking them down to $100) when you purchase them together. To take advantage of that bundle offer, highlight the orange “Extra Savings” box on the product page, then hit “Add both to cart.” Currently, the black, silver, and violet colors are available with this deal.
