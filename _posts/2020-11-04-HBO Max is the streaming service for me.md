In the last year, the number of streaming platforms has really gotten out of hand. There's Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, CBS All Access (soon to be Paramount Plus), and Peacock â€” and each of them has different pricing tiers. If you scored free trials for Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, like I did, you probably got to sample a healthy selection of them. Those trials, however, are starting to wind down. Which means it's time to figure out what's worth keeping and what's worth ditching: with this many monthly bills, you should absolutely play favorites. I was surprised to learn mine was HBO Max.
