Microsoft is finally starting to roll out history and tab sync for its Edge browser. After nearly a year since its initial release, some Microsoft Edge users now see the full web history and tab sync features available in their browsers. The roll out is gradual, but you can check to see if it's available in your country by navigating to settings > profiles > sync and enabling “history” and “open tabs” in the options.
