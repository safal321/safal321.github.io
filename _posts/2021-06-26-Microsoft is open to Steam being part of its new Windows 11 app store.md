Microsoft's surprise change to Windows 11 is a much more open approach to its Windows store, and it could mean we see Steam games listed in the future. This new open approach sees many changes to the Windows app store, including Microsoft connecting up to Amazon's Appstore to list Android apps and allowing developers to keep 100 percent of their revenue by using third-party payment platforms. Microsoft also wants other alternative app stores, like Steam and Epic Games Store, to be part of this new Windows app store.
