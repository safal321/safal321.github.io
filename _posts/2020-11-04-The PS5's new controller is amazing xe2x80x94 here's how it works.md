When I first picked up the PlayStation 5's new DualSense controller I was totally blown away by the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The PS5 ships with Astro's Playroom, which is the perfect showcase for this controller and everything it's capable of. Sony has added haptic feedback to its new PS5 controller that makes you feel the environment in Astro's Playroom, with adaptive triggers that provide tension when you're drawing a bow or pulling on a cord.
