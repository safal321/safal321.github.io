YouTube has suspended Rudy Giuliani's YouTube channel for the second time this year for making false claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election and has issued a strike against his channel. It's Giulani's second strike within 90 days, according to Bloomberg, meaning that Giuliani cannot upload videos for two weeks. In a statement, YouTube also cited Giulani's promotion of nicotine, which is against the company's rules.
