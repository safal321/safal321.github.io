Sling is providing free TV from 5PM to midnight each night, as part of a new initiative to encourage Americans to stay home. Starting today, new Sling TV customers can register for the service, which the company is calling “Happy Hour Across America.” Don't worry — Sling isn't asking for a credit card, so you won't have to worry about canceling later on.
