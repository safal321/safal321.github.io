Twitch had a good 2020. Events were virtual; people stayed inside. The live-streaming site managed to clock 17 billion hours watched last year, which is a full 83 percent higher than 2019's 9 billion, according to the latest report from StreamElements and Arsenal.gg. The jump wasn't limited to Twitch; Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming also posted their best numbers ever last year.
