General Motors is delaying the upcoming reveal of the new all-electric Hummer truck, which was originally scheduled for May 20th because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The automaker isn't yet offering a replacement date for the launch of the new electric vehicle, but it says that the production schedule isn't currently affected. The new Hummer is due out in late 2021.
