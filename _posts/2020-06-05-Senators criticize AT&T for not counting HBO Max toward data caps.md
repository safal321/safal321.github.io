Senators Ed Markey (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CO) have written a letter to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson criticizing the company's decision to exempt HBO Max streaming data from counting toward AT&T mobile customers' data caps.

The letter follows AT&T's recent confirmation to The Verge that HBO Max data wouldn't count toward AT&T's mobile data caps.
