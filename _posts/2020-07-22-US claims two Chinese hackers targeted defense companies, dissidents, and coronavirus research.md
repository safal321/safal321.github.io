The US Justice Department has charged two alleged Chinese hackers with stealing trade secrets and other valuable data from companies worldwide, including firms working on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Prosecutors claim some of the hacks were carried out on behalf of China's Ministry of State Security, while others were done for personal profit. The pair are currently wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
