Amazon's Echo Buds wireless earbuds are $40 off at Amazon, which brings them down to their lowest-yet price of $90. This isn't the first time we've seen this deal, but it doesn't happen regularly. (It happened once before in January 2020.) If you're in the market for wireless earbuds, these are a particularly good value if you're seeking a solid set of noise-canceling buds. They utilize Bose noise-reduction technology to help block out sound, and they're also worth the price, thanks to their excellent sound quality and comfortable fit.
