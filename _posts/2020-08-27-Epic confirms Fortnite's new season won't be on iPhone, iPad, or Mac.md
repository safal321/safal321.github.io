Epic has confirmed it will not be releasing its upcoming Fortnite season, Chapter 2: Season 4, for iOS or macOS, saying the ongoing antitrust feud with Apple over in-app payment processing and other App Store disputes has blocked it from issuing updates and new installs on Apple devices. While this was a suspected development after Fortnite's removal earlier this month — Epic warned it could happen the day the app was pulled — the season's launch on Thursday, August 27th had been fast approaching without formal word from Epic on its plans.
