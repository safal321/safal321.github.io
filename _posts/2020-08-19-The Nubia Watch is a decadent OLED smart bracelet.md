Some of the first credible reporting about the “Apple iWatch” I remember reading described it as being “made of curved glass.” The eventual Apple Watch did use curved glass to an extent, of course, but it wasn't really a defining feature of the product. After all, in 2013 The New York Times said Apple's watch was expected to “stand apart from competitors based on the company's understanding of how such glass can curve around the human body.” I was imagining something a little more futuristic than what we got.
