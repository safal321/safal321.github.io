Final Fantasy VII Remake has held fairly steady at $60 since it launched in April 2020, but the disc-based version for PS4 is currently down to $40 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. My colleague Andrew Webster called it a “thrilling, thoughtful take on a classic” in his review. In case you weren't aware, the FF7R covers the first portion of the game in Midgar. That section isn't too long in the original title, but Square Enix completely reimagined the world and fleshed it out with more quests, a new battle system, and some slight changes to the story.
