Podcast studios are now a Las Vegas attraction. Wynn Resorts announced today that it's investing $3.5 million in Blue Wire, a sports podcasting network, in a deal that'll include the build out of a podcasting studio in the Wynn Las Vegas' lobby. That studio will host Blue Wire podcast personalities as well as star athlete guests to entice people to visit the hotel, get excited about sports, and hopefully place bets on them. Wynn runs a subsidiary business called WynnBet, which handles sports betting, and the team specifically eyed Blue Wire to promote that brand.
