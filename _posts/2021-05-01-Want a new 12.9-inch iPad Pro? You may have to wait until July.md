If you're hoping to get one of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pros with a Mini LED display, you may be waiting a while — the delivery times for even the base model have slipped to late June or early July (via Bloomberg). Leading up to the device's announcement, there were rumors that the display tech could be a production bottleneck for Apple, and that appears to be the case — Apple's site says the 11-inch iPad Pro, announced alongside the 12.9-inch, would be delivered in late May.
