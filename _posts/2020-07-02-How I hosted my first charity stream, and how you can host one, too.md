Congratulations! The world is falling apart (or at least feels like it's falling apart), and you've decided to do something about it. That's a commendable urge. Here's where I tell you that you've also decided to do something very hard. Hosting a charity stream (on Twitch, YouTube, or on any other platform) is much more difficult than hosting a regular live stream, mostly because charity streams involve more moving parts â€” there's the charity, the donation flow, guests, and, obviously, anything else you're doing to make the experience special for your viewers.
