Fujifilm has just announced a new camera in its X-series mirrorless lineup, the X-S10. The new model is a bit of a departure from Fujifilm's other cameras, and features a control scheme that'll be familiar to shooters of other camera systems. It also has plenty of vlogger-friendly features, including a fully articulating display, in-body image stabilization, and a microphone input.
