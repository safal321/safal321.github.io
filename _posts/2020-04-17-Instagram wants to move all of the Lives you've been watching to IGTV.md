Instagram Live launched in 2016, but it took a pandemic for the feature to really take off. The company says Live usage is up over 70 percent in the US, so it's rolling out a couple of new features to make watching and saving the content easier. It's officially allowing everyone around the world to watch and comment on Live videos from their desktop after first launching it as a test, and it's also now testing a button that allows people to upload their finished live streams directly to IGTV. With that button, they can also choose to share a preview of their video to their feed and profile. Comments and question stickers will not carry over to IGTV.
