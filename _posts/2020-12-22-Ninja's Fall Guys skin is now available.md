Fall Guys developer Mediatonic has added a skin based on the hugely-popular streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins to the game. The skin's arrival follows a two-week charity bidding war in August to have a custom skin added to the game. Blevins, G2 Esports, Aim Lab, and Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson pledged a combined $1 million to Special Effect, which helps people with physical disabilities find ways to play video games.
