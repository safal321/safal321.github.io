Motorola's new Razr stopped being able to fully fold after just over 27,000 folds and around three-and-a-half hours in CNET's “FoldBot” folding machine. Problems were discovered after the team took the phone out of the machine to check it for the third time, after which they realized it was struggling to fold. When they finally did manage to close it, the hinge appeared to have fallen out of alignment. However, despite the folding problems, the phone's screen was still fully functional.
