After a controversial blog post in which CEO Jason Fried outlined Basecamp's new philosophy that prohibited, among other things, “societal and political discussions” on internal forums, company co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson said the company would offer generous severance packages to anyone who disagreed with the new stance. On Friday, it appears a large number of Basecamp employees are taking Hansson up on his offer: according to The Verge contributing editor Casey Newton's sources, roughly a third of the company's 57 employees accepted buyouts today. As of Friday afternoon, 18 people had tweeted they were planning to leave.
