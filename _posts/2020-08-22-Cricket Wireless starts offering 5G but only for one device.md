AT&T-owned Cricket Wireless is enabling 5G support on some of its plans, the company announced. But oddly, even though the appeal to most customers of prepaid plans like Cricket is a lower price, the company's only 5G compatible device so far is the $1,199 Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus. And getting access to 5G on Cricket requires subscribing to one of its Unlimited plans, which start at $60 per month.
