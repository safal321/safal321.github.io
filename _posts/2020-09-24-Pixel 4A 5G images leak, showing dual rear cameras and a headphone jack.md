UK retailer John Lewis has accidentally posted images of Google's Pixel 4A 5G a little early, giving us a detailed look at the new mid-range phone's design. The images, fist spotted by 9to5Google, are accidentally on display on the retailer's Pixel 4A 4G LTE listing, where they show a 5G logo in the phone's status bar and a rear camera layout that doesn't match the Pixel 4A's. The images confirm several of the Pixel 4A 5G specs that leaked yesterday, including a second rear camera and the headphone jack that carries over from the Pixel 4A.
