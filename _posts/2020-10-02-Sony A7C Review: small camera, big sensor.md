When I first heard about Sony's new A7C, I thought it was just a parts-bin camera â€” taking a lot of good things about the Alpha line and putting it into a new design. On paper, that's exactly what the $1,800 A7C is: it's the sensor, processor, and autofocus system of 2018's A7 III in a body that's closer in size to the A6600.
