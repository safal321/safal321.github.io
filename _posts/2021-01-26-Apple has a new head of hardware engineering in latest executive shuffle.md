Apple's hardware team is getting its biggest shakeup in nearly a decade, as Dan Riccio — who served as the company's senior vice president of hardware engineering since 2012 — transitions to “a new role” at the company. He'll be replaced as Apple's head hardware engineer by John Ternus, who led the hardware team designing the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, in addition to working on Apple's M1 chips. Ternus has been vice president of hardware engineering at Apple since 2013.
