If you want to get more out of your internet connection, buying a mesh Wi-Fi system is a smart way to cover more of your home in reliable Wi-Fi signal â€” and today is a good time to jump in. That's because a three-pack of Eero mesh Wi-Fi routers is down to $170 at Best Buy and Amazon. It usually costs $250, and with this $80 discount, it's almost like getting one of the routers for no cost. Plus, your purchase will include a free Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker. Those normally cost around $50.
