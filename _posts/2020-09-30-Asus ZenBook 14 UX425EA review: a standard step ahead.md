Asus has so many ZenBook 14 models it stresses me out. There's the UX433, a 2.6-pound slim-bezeled affair. There's the Flip 14, an elegant convertible. There's the UX431, a mid-tier $900 option. And there's the UX425, which Asus quietly rolled out earlier this summer, that included a few tweaks to the traditional ZenBook design. Announced earlier this month were the UX435, with a tiny secondary display in place of the touchpad, and the UX425EA.
