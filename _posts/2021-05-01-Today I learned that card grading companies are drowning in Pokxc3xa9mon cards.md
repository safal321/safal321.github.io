A report from Vice has opened my eyes to just how big the Pokxc3xa9mon trading card collecting market is getting â€” apparently to the point where card rating companies have waitlists that range from six to ten months, with one company claiming it's receiving over 500,000 cards to grade per week. The card graders, who rate trading cards' conditions to determine how collectable (and therefore valuable) they are, are so swamped that people who want to get their Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, or sports cards graded are also having to wait in line (or pay out the nose to skip it).
