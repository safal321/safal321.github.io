Google's new $50 Chromecast with Google TV will support a lot of the streaming services most people would want, although Apple TV Plus appears to be a notable holdout. Those sorts of gaps are fairly normal for a new platform, but the new Chromecast does have one very strange omission: Google's own game streaming service, Stadia. At launch, the new Chromecast with Google TV won't support it. Google says support will come sometime in the first half of 2021.
