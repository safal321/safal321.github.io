This week's best deals are all over the place, but in a good way. There's the ever-handy GorillaPod tripod shown above, as well as excellent deals on Sony noise-canceling headphones and the PC version of Resident Evil Village. You can also find other deals that are likely still up for grabs here, including the first notable discount on the Apple AirPods Max, as well as hefty price cuts on the Fitbit Charge 4 fitness tracker and Sony's Back Button attachment for the PS4.
