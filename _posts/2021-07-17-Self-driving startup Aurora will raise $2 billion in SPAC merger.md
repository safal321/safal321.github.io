Self-driving technology startup Aurora, which was founded by the former head of Google's autonomous vehicle program, is the latest company to announce that it's going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC). The deal will give Aurora about $2 billion in new cash when it closes, which will help the startup in its quest to become a provider of self-driving hardware and software to companies in the trucking and ride-hailing industries.
