Amazon will give all employees diagnosed with the novel coronavirus or put into quarantine up to two weeks of pay, the company announced today. That includes the company's part-time warehouse workers, according to The Wall Street Journal. The move follows Amazon's decision to pay hourly workers who support its campuses even if they're asked not to come to work due to coronavirus through the end of March, which the company announced last Friday.
