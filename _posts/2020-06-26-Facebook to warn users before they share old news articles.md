Facebook is rolling out a new feature globally that will warn users if they're about to share an article that's over 90 days old. The feature, which was announced in a blog post, is designed to give people more context about articles before they share them, in the hope that the content on the platform becomes more “timely and credible.” Users still have the option of sharing an article after seeing the notification.
