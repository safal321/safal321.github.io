The second-generation Apple Pencil, released in 2018, that can magnetically attach to the iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets that feature USB-C ports is $20 off at Woot. It's a relatively small discount on its usual $129 price, but it seems like the best deal on the stylus happening right now. Compared to the infamous first iteration that can only recharge by plugging into a Lightning port, endangering itself while also looking very silly, this one charges wirelessly through the side of the iPad Pro or Air. It also supports gesture controls on the side of the Apple Pencil.
