Over the last several years, Jabra's true wireless earbuds have consistently earned positive reviews and are often at the top of recommendation lists for people who aren't interested in Apple's AirPods. Last month, the company announced its latest set â€” and first to ship with active noise cancellation. The $230 Elite 85t are Jabra's most premium earbuds yet and meant to go toe-to-toe with the AirPods Pro and Bose's new QuietComfort Earbuds. But in a surprise bonus, Jabra said it would bring ANC (albeit a less effective implementation) to its existing Elite 75t and Elite Active 75t via a firmware update.
