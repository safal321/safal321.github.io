Rebecca Black has released a 10th anniversary remix of her viral hit “Friday.” Yes, somehow, the original song came out 10 years ago, and I have never felt so old. The original song came out on February 10th, 2011, which weirdly means this new version of “Friday” happens to be released on a Wednesday morning.
