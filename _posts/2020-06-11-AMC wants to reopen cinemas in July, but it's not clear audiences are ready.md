AMC has reiterated its hope to reopen the company's cinemas in July after posting a staggering financial loss, The Wall Street Journal reports. On an earnings call yesterday, the company's CEO Adam Aron said that he expects 97 percent of the company's US locations to reopen by next month, after AMC was forced to close theaters in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. AMC operates over 1,000 theaters, and more than 11,000 screens, globally. Recent surveys, however, suggest that movie-goers aren't ready to return in substantial numbers.
