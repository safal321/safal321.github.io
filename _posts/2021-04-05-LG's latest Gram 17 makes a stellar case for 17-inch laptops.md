I've read plenty about what it's like to use, hold, and type on an LG Gram before, but that didn't take away from the impressive first impression it made when I used the new Gram 17 for the first time â€” especially this larger model. The Gram 17 has a grandiose 17-inch display, yet it's only three pounds, which is light enough for me to carry around one-handed. Its keyboard is a joy to type on with a surprising amount of tactility and travel in the keys, and the battery life outlasts a whole day of work, even much of a second one, too. It's a quiet laptop, and even under pressure, its fans weren't loud enough for me to hear once.
