Adobe has released more details on its Content Authenticity Initiative, a system for permanently attaching sources and details to an image. The project is meant to mitigate two problems: artists losing credit for work and newsworthy images being manipulated or taken out of context. It's set for a limited debut on Adobe's Photoshop software and Behance social network by the end of 2020, and Adobe hopes for wider adoption soon after.
