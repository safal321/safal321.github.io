The next expansion of the sprawling League of Legends universe is something unexpected: a board game called Tellstones. This isn't developer Riot's first foray into tabletop games — that would be 2016's Mechs vs. Minions — but what makes Tellstones interesting is that it's a game set within the franchise's expansive fantasy realm. “We portray Tellstones as a game that's actually played in Runeterra, as part of their history and culture in the same way that chess or mancala have ancient roots in our own world,” explains Greg Street, Riot's VP of IP and entertainment.
