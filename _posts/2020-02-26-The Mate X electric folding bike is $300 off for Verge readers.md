Several configurations of the Mate X electric folding bike are $300 off at Wellbots. The most affordable option usually costs $1,999, but the offer code THEVERGEBIKE will bring that price down to $1,699 to start. The price varies depending on the color, how powerful of a battery you want (14Ah or 17Ah), and whether you prefer mechanical or hydraulic brakes. The most expensive version is usually priced at $2,299, so this exclusive offer code will get it down just below the $2,000 mark.
