As the holidays get closer (and with some arriving now â€” Happy Hanukkah!), we're searching for tech deals that make for easy, relatively affordable gifts. It's always nice when the selection fits a particular theme, but sometimes you've got to take what you can get. Like today, wherein we have a great buy one, get one half off deal on some Nintendo Switch games at Target, a solid deal on lightly used Sony WH-1000XM4 wireless, noise-canceling headphones, and a few other odds and ends.
