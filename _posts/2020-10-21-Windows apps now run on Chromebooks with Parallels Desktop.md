Google is bringing Windows app support to Chromebooks today through a partnership with Parallels. First announced earlier this year, Chrome OS will now boot a full version of Windows inside a virtual machine to gain access to existing desktop apps. It's designed for businesses, which means only enterprise customers will be able to purchase the app for $69.99 per user.
