Today only, Best Buy is discounting the 13.3-inch Dell Inspiron 7000 2-in-1 laptop. It usually costs $850, but you can get one for $600. This laptop won't outperform options that cost considerably more, but it seems to be a well-rounded machine for those who don't use intensive applications â€” especially at this price. It has a 1080p touchscreen that can rotate 360-degrees for tablet mode or watching movies in tent mode, and Intel's Core i5-10210U processor powers the machine, with 8GB of RAM, and a fast 512GB PCIe SSD keeping it going. It even has a fingerprint reader for logging in securely.
