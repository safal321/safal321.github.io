Triumph, the premium British motorcycle brand most preferred by James Bond, is out with a new two-wheeler of a different sort. The Trekker GT is the world-famous motorcycle maker's first electric bicycle, and, at first glance, it appears to be a highly capable commuter model. It won't be cheap, though: the bike will be going on sale in Europe, the UK, and the US for xc2xa32,950 ($3,318).
