The LG Velvet has finally officially launched in South Korea, following weeks of teases and announcements. As expected, the phone features a “raindrop” triple rear camera array, is powered by a Snapdragon 765, and has a 6.8-inch OLED display with a small central notch. Details about its global launch are expected to come later this month.
