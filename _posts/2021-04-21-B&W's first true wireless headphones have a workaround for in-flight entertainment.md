Bowers and Wilkins' debut pair of noise cancelling true wireless earbuds, the PI7, fix one of the key annoyances with the form-factor â€” it's usable with in-flight entertainment systems because the case doubles as an audio transmitter. Plug the case into an audio source using an included 3.5mm to USB-C cable and it will retransmit the audio wirelessly to the earbuds. Alongside it, Bowers and Wilkins has also announced the less expensive PI5 true wireless headphones, which also offer noise-cancellation.
