Microsoft is planning to show off some Xbox Series X gameplay next month. The software maker will hold a special Inside Xbox stream on May 7th, with the focus squarely on games for the Xbox Series X. Microsoft's event will include next-gen gameplay from Microsoft's “global developers partners,” but Xbox Game Studios games titles will be showcased at a later date.
