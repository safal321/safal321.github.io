One day after YouTube TV announced a $15 price hike that had customers crying out “enough already,” Dish's Sling TV service is promising that it won't raise prices on existing customers until at least August 2021. The company seems keen on using the frustration toward YouTube to help boost its own subscriptions; this offer is extended to anyone who signs up for Sling by August 1st and maintains service. (That, of course, leaves open the possibility that new customers who come on board after August 1st will start off with higher pricing...)
