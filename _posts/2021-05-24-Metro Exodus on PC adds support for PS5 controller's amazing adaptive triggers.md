Metro Exodus has become one of the first PC games to support the PS5 DualSense controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers thanks to a recent patch. Although many PC games already support the PS5 controller's basic features, with Valve adding support for it to its Steam Input API last year, Metro Exodus now supports its advanced haptics, as well as its trigger features, which add extra resistance depending on what you're doing in-game.
