Samsung's successor to its ill-fated Galaxy Fold could be available with less storage at a cheaper price, according to a new report from SamMobile. The cheaper model will reportedly have 256GB of internal storage and will be offered alongside a 512GB model. In contrast, the original Galaxy Fold was only available with 512GB of storage for an eye-watering $1,980.
