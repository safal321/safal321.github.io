Olympus today announced the OM-D E-M1 Mark III, following up its predecessor from 2016. The weather-sealed design is almost untouched from last generation, though it's more capable in the image quality department. In some cases, it even outclasses the 2019 E-M1X, Olympus' pro-grade mirrorless Micro Four Thirds camera, while being more compact and affordable. This new entry costs $1,799.99 (body only), which is $200 less than Olympus charged for the E-M1 Mark II body.
