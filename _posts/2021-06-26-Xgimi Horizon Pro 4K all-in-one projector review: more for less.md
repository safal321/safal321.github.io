Xgimi's latest all-in-one smart projector not only looks good, but it supports native 4K and HDR content. Better yet, the Xgimi Horizon Pro boots straight into Android TV and features a pair of 8W Harman Kardon speakers that sound great despite the projector's compact size. Couple that with a bright LED light source, built-in Wi-Fi, and the ability to automatically avoid obstacles when determining where to project the image, and you've got a 300-inch display that can go anywhere there's a power outlet and a flat surface. Hell, it'll even double as a Bluetooth speaker in a pinch.
