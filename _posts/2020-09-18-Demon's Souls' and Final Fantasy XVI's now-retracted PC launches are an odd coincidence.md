As part of its PlayStation 5 launch event yesterday, Sony said Final Fantasy XVI and Demon's Souls weren't just strictly PS5 exclusives â€” trailers for both games revealed they would also be coming to PC. At the time, that meant the biggest game announced during Sony's showcase as well as one of the PS5's most notable launch titles wouldn't require a PS5 to play them. If you added the fact that both Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Horizon Forbidden West will also be coming to PS4, you might well have decided to wait on picking up a PS5 at launch.
