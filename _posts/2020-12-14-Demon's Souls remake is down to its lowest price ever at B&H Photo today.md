The holiday shopping season is in full swing; if you are still looking for gifts to give to loved ones or even yourself, there are still plenty of deals to consider. Today's best deals include historically low prices across several categories, including $20 of instant savings on one of the best (don't at me) PS5 console exclusives, the best price ever on Jabra's 75t wireless earbuds, and Nvidia's Shield TV Pro for as low as $179.
