If you're on the hunt for a gaming laptop to help you run your games at reasonably fast frame rates that will also serve as a great all-around machine for non-gaming tasks, the Razer Blade 15 is a solid option. You can get this machine at Amazon for $400 off its original price, which brings it down to $1,400. It comes with Intel's competent six-core Core i7-10750H processor, Nvidia's RTX 2060 graphics chip, 16GB of RAM, and a fast 512GB SSD.
