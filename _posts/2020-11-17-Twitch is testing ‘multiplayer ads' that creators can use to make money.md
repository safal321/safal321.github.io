Today, Twitch is rolling out something it's calling “multiplayer ads” in closed beta. They're ads triggered by streamers that all viewers watch. (Currently, ads shown to viewers are targeted; these are not.) After one of these ads plays, creators can run a poll for their viewers that awards the streamer bits depending on how many viewers participate.
