Sony has announced the A7C, a new camera that is by far the smallest model yet in its Alpha range of full-frame mirrorless cameras. The A7C looks more like one of Sony's APS-C models like the A6400 than an A7, adopting a more compact body with the electronic viewfinder on the top left corner of the camera's back panel, rangefinder-style.
