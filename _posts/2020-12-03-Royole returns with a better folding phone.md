Remember the first folding phone? No, not Samsung's ill-fated original Galaxy Fold â€” the one that beat it to market. In hindsight, and honestly in foresight back then as well, Royole's FlexPai was a hurried attention grab that existed solely to attain world-first status. But it's not like it came out of nowhere; Royole had been set up several years earlier solely to develop flexible screen technology, so it's understandable that the company would want to get ahead of Samsung to show off what it could do. A flex, if you will.
