After much confusion, LG has confirmed that AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support will be coming to some of its 2018 TV models, in addition to its newer 2019 and 2020 TVs. “LG's 2018 TVs will add support for Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit later this year,” the company's official UK Twitter account tweeted, and said more details would be shared as the features become available. LG UK also said that the Apple TV app is also now available worldwide for the company's 2018 OLED and Super UHD LCD TVs.
