Apple's rocky rollout of iCloud password sync on Windows has hit another bump: you can no longer download the version of the app that allowed syncing passwords from your Apple devices with your Chrome web browser on a Windows PC (via Windows Central). Version 12 of Apple's iCloud for Windows app released last week with supposed support for the feature, but the Chrome extension to make it work wasn't available until two days ago. Now, version 12 is gone from the Windows Store, with version 11.6 taking its place.
