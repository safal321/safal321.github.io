Facebook introduced Stories to its platform four years ago, mostly as a way to encourage people to post content that wasn't highly produced or necessarily photogenic. Now, it's giving some users a chance to make money through that content. The company announced a test today that'll allow some creators to place ads that look like stickers into their stories and receive a cut of the resulting revenue. The initial test is “very small,” Facebook says, but it hopes to expand it “soon” and then apply the technology to all short-form videos on Facebook.
