Razer says it's planning to ship its concept reusable N95 face mask. Unveiled back in January, Project Hazel includes active disc-type ventilators, Chroma RGB lighting, and voice projection. The face mask is also transparent, allowing for lip-reading and the ability to see facial cues when you talk to people.
