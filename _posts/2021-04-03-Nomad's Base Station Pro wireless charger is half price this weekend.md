Nomad's well-designed Base Station Pro is a Qi wireless charger that can charge up to three devices simultaneously â€” perfect if you have a phone, watch, and earbuds. If its $200 price tag has been a stumbling block, Nomad is offering a 50 percent discount on the charger until Sunday, April 4th, at 2:59AM ET (Saturday at 11:59PM PT if you're on the West Coast). To get this price, enter the code VOX at checkout. If you have an Apple Watch, you can also add the Apple Watch attachment for $5.
