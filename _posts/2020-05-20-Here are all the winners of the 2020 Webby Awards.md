Lil Nas X's “Panini,” NASA's social media presence, Rihanna's Fenty Beauty line, and John Krasinski's Some Good News YouTube show are among the winners of this year's Webby Awards. The annual awards show celebrates the wide variety of things that happen online, from websites and podcasts to design and data visualizations to video series and social media accounts, and they tend to touch on a big swath of what happened in the preceding year.
