I wish I could tell you exactly where I think the Motorola Razr went wrong, but there are too many options to choose from. It's the first of a new generation of folding devices that open vertically into a regular phone shape instead of horizontally into a mini-tablet like Samsung's Galaxy Fold. That means Motorola had the benefit of learning from earlier missteps from the Fold and a very few other devices, but it still makes too many mistakes of its own.
