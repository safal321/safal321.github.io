Apple Maps will now show COVID-19 testing sites in all 50 states and Puerto Rico (via TechCrunch). When you search using terms like “COVID-19 test” or “coronavirus test,” places that offer COVID-19 tests will be marked on your map. If you start typing COVID-19 into the search bar, you'll also see the “COVID-19 Testing” search term appear at the top of your search bar, like what you'd see if you started typing something like “groceries” or “coffee shops.”
