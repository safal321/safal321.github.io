It's not tough to get around paying the full $49.99 price on Google's Nest Mini smart speaker. Right now, Google sells them for $35 each, and during the holiday season last year, they dropped down to $25. Those are good prices, but Daily Steals is offering Verge readers a discount on a two-pack that's considerably better. By using the offer code VERGENEST at checkout, you can get two for $46.99.
