Google recently ran a promotion that offered two of its Nest Mini speakers for $78. That's technically a deal since one usually costs around $50, though Daily Steals is doing it better for Verge readers today with a two-pack of Nest Minis for just $40. Just make sure to enter the code VERGENEST2 once you go to checkout. It currently has the chalk, charcoal, and coral colorways available, and these are all brand-new devices with their original one-year warranty from Google.
