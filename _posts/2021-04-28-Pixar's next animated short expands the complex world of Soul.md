From the very beginning of Pixar's Soul, 22 — a soul who refuses to come down to Earth — is cynical. She hates the idea of inhabiting a body or finding her inspiration, instead being content with spending eternity in the “great before,” a space meant to prepare souls for their human lives. Viewers don't really get a sense of why she feels that way — but that's about to change in the upcoming animated short 22 vs. Earth.
