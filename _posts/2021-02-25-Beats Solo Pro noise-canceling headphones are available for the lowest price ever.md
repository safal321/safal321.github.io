Woot is offering the best sale price we've seen yet on the Beats Solo Pro noise-canceling headphones. Normally $300, the light blue and dark blue color options are $150 new. These headphones come with a one-year manufacturer warranty directly through Apple. The lowest price we've seen previously is around the $170 mark, depending on the color you're interested in. The Solo Pro headphones are compatible with Android and iOS, but they shine brighter on iPhone, since they have the H1 wireless chip and “Hey Siri” hands-free controls. The downside for Android owners used to USB-C is that they recharge through a Lightning connector.
