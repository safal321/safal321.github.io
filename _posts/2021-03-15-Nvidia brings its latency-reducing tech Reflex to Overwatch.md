An update to Overwatch's Public Test Region (PTR) is bringing Nvida's latency-reduction tech, called Reflex, to the popular esports title (via Engadget). The tech aims to help reduce the amount of time between when you click your mouse, and when you see the resulting action on screen, making the game feel more responsive. The fact that it's coming to Overwatch was announced back in January, but it's now available to players who can access the PTR, and who have the latest Nvidia drivers.
