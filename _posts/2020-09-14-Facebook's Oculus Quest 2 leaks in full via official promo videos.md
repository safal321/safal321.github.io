The Oculus Quest 2 VR headset has leaked in full via a pair of promotional videos uploaded to a marketing hub run by parent company Facebook, The videos outline the specs of the standalone headset, which is a successor to 2019's Oculus Quest. Also listed on the site is a pair of live demos of the headset, scheduled for September 16th and 17th. That lines up neatly with a previously-rumored launch date for the Quest 2 of September 15th.
