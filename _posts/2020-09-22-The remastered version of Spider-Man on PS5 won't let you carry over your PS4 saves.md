Insomniac Games' hugely-successful 2018 hit Spider-Man is being remastered for PlayStation 5 with ray-tracing, faster loading, and support for the DualSense controller's new haptic feedback. And better yet, it'll be available on the PS5's launch day as a pack-in with Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition.
