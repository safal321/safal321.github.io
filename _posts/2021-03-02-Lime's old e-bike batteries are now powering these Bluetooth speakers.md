Accessory manufacturer Gomi is launching a limited edition Bluetooth speaker powered by batteries from old Lime e-bikes. In its announcement of the partnership, Lime says Gomi will use 50,000 battery cells from over 1,000 old e-bikes. The result is a Bluetooth speaker priced starting at xc2xa399 (around $138) that has 20 hours of battery life and will be available for 30 days as part of a Kickstarter launching later today.
