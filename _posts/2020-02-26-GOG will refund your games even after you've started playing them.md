Digital games store Good Old Games has updated its refund policy to offer refunds within 30 days of purchasing a game, regardless of whether you've downloaded and played it within that timeframe. Previously, the store considered your purchase final once you downloaded your game, after which point, you could only get a refund if the game had technical issues.
