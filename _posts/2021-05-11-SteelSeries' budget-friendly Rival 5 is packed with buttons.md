SteelSeries has debuted its Rival 5 wired, right-handed gaming mouse that is available right now for $59.99. From a distance, the Rival 5 looks similar to the modular Rival 600, but this is a simpler and slightly more ergonomically friendly mouse. The overall shape of the device seems to have a softer curve, making it fit a little more comfortably for palm or fingertip grip users.
