In a statement to The Verge, a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson has defended the agency's seizure of 2,000 pairs of OnePlus Buds at JFK airport on August 31st. Last night, CBP publicized the action and described the OnePlus Buds as “counterfeit Apple AirPods,” which set off a wave of controversy. It seemed like a possible gaffe by border officers who somehow didn't realize they were blocking a genuine product, and OnePlus has also been mocked for even finding itself in this situation, thanks to the similarities between its own earbuds and AirPods.
