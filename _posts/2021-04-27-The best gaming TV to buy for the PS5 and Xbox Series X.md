We're several months into the next generation of console gaming with the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. And if you didn't upgrade the TV that you're playing on before buying a new console — first off, congrats on finding one — now is as good a time as any. The latest 2021 TV models from LG, Samsung, Sony, and other companies are now shipping, and many of them are optimized for HDMI 2.1 and gaming features like variable refresh rate (VRR), auto low latency mode (ALLM), and buttery-smooth 120Hz action.
