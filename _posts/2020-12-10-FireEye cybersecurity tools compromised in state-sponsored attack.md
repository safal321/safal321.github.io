One of the US's leading cybersecurity firms, FireEye, says it's been hacked by a state-sponsored attacker. Hackers targeted and accessed the firm's so-called Red Team tools, which it uses to test customer security and find vulnerabilities. Now there's concern that the hackers could release these tools publicly or use them to attack others, though there is no evidence that this has happened yet. FireEye says that it does not believe any customer information was taken.
