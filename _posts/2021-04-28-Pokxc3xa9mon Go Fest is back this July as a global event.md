The annual Pokxc3xa9mon Go Fest is back again this summer, scheduled for July 17th and 18th. Last year's event was held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of taking place in person in select cities around the globe. It sounds like this year's fest will once again happen virtually; developer Niantic describes the event as a “global event.”
