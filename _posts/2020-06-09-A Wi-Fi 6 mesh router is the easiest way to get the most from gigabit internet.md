Gigabit home internet has been available in the US for some time, but in the past couple of years, more people have been able to sign up for it. Even though the average home broadband connection is just around 130Mbps, at least 80 percent of US households are able to get gigabit broadband service, according to a report from the NCTA. Of those, between 2.5 percent and 6 percent of homes actually have it, depending on which report you read.
