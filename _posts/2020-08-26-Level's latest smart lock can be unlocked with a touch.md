Level is a relatively new company in the smart home scene, but today it's announcing its second product of the year: the Level Touch. The Touch uses the same clever engineering and sleek design of the Level Bolt, but packages it into a full lock replacement and doesn't rely on any existing deadbolt parts you may have. It costs $329 and is available in a variety of finishes from Level's website starting today.
