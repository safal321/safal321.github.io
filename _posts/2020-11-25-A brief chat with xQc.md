Last week, the streamer Fxc3xa9lix “xQcOW” Lengyel was temporarily banned from Twitch for cheating at a GlitchCon Twitch Rivals event. It was the third time this year he's been suspended from Twitch, and his teammates Rabia “Nightblue3” Yazbek and Lucas “Mendo” Hxc3xa5kansson were banned alongside him. I got in touch with Lengyel to chat about what happened, and what he's learned from the experience.
