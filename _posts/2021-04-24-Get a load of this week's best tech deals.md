It's the weekend, so that's our cue to fire off this handy list of the best tech deals we've laid eyes on over the past few days. There weren't many big surprise price drops, but that doesn't mean there weren't some great pieces of tech to buy. This week's best deals are for people trying to stretch their dollar as far as possible. There's a discount on a feature-packed soundbar for under $100, and Google's Pixel 3 that has a solid camera is just $170. Plus, there are some more gaming deals below.
