Images of what appears to be an S Pen stylus and carrying case for Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S21 Ultra have leaked online, WinFuture reports. They show a stylus that looks similar in appearance to Samsung's previous S Pens, as well as a phone case that's a little wider than the handset itself to allow space for the optional accessory. WinFuture reports that the stylus will be sold separately from the phone for just under xe2x82xac40 (around $49).
