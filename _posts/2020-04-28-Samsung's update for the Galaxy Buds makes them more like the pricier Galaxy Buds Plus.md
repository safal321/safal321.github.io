Samsung released its second version of truly wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Plus, earlier this year, and now it's bringing some of their functionality to its original earbuds, the Galaxy Buds. The company says today it's rolling out an update that'll allow Galaxy Buds to connect to multiple devices at once and give them support for Microsoft Swift Pair, which pairs the Galaxy Buds with Windows 10 devices more quickly. The Galaxy Buds will also support ambient sound automatically, meaning sound will pass through the earbuds even if someone is listening to content. (The Galaxy Buds aren't noise-canceling, but the ambient mode prioritizes “important” sounds so listeners don't get lost in their audio content.)
