On Monday, roughly 230 Google employees announced they were forming a union with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). It's open to employees and contractors at Alphabet, Google's parent company. As a minority union, it doesn't need to go through a formal legal process in order to exist. It just needs to announce itself. That part is done. World, meet the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU).
