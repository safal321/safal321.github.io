I started becoming obsessed with EarthCam's Times Square live stream a few weeks ago. Instead of habitually opening Instagram or Facebook when I was bored, I'd check in on some low-res strangers from the safety of my apartment. It was oddly comforting to see that the blazing walls of billboards and larger-than-life store names were still there, even if the streets around them were unusually empty. The barrage of LED advertisements felt a little less searing on a small laptop screen than they do in real life.
