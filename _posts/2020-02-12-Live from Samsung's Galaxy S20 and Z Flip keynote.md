Samsung is back with another Unpacked event in San Francisco. The Verge is here to live blog the keynote, which begins at 11AM PT / 2PM ET. What should you expect? Phones, lots of phones. Specifically, the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus, and Galaxy S20 Ultra. Plus, expect Samsung's second attempt at a folding phone, the Galaxy Z Flip, which is rumored to be the first folding phone with glass instead of plastic on the screen.
