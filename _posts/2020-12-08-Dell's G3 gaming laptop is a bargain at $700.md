Today's hand-picked batch of best tech deals is mostly centered on laptops and tablets, which I'm always happy to see discounted. Whether you want to get stuff done or just do some gaming on an iPad, a more budget-friendly Android tablet from Samsung, or on a Windows 10 laptop, there are a few solid options to choose from. There are also some excellent price cuts on two Chromebooks below that come recommended by Verge reviewer Monica Chin.
