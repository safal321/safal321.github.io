Yesterday, Apple announced a new iPad Pro along with an updated keyboard case â€” now with a trackpad. The company also confirmed that it's bringing laptop-like trackpad and mouse functionality to iPadOS, and it's doing so sooner than some anticipated. The new context-aware cursor and other trackpad / mouse features are coming next week as part of the iPadOS 13.4 update.
