Apple's over-ear AirPods Max are $30 less than usual at Amazon and Best Buy today. Normally $549, every color option is $520 (Best Buy has most, but not all, colors at this price). Are they worth the purchase even with this slightly more affordable cost? If you're a discerning shopper looking for unparalleled design and build quality, as well as great sound quality and ease of use, then perhaps they'll be worth it to you.
