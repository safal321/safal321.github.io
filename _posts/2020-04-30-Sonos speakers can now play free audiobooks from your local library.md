You can now use your Sonos speaker to listen to free audiobooks from your local library, thanks to a new integration with OverDrive's Libby app. After downloading the Libby app, you'll be prompted to register with a valid library card. Then, the app can be connected to a Sonos system and used to play any available audiobooks. Progress syncs across devices, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off if you've been listening elsewhere.
