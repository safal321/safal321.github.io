Google is expanding efforts to design its own chips with the hiring of Uri Frank, an Intel veteran with over two decades of experience in custom CPU design, the company has announced. Frank will head up a new Isreal-based team for Google, and will serve as the company's VP of Engineering for server chip design. “I look forward to growing a team here in Israel while accelerating Google Cloud's innovations in compute infrastructure,” Frank wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing the move.
