The European Commission is once again investigating Qualcomm over what it believes could be anti-competitive practices, Qualcomm revealed in its latest earnings report. This time, the commission is concerned with how Qualcomm is selling its radio frequency front-end (RFFE) chips, which form part of the link between a phone's antenna and modem. According to Reuters, it's an area into which Qualcomm is in the process of expanding, and the chips are growing more complex, thanks to the demands of 5G. The investigation was subsequently confirmed by the European Commission in a statement given to TechCrunch.
