If you want to buy Jack Dorsey's first tweet, you'd better get your bid in. The billionaire co-founder and CEO of Twitter put the tweet up for digital auction as an NFT —non-fungible token— a digital good that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. Dorsey's 15-year-old tweet is up for sale  on a platform called Valuables by Cent that lets people make offers on tweets that are “autographed by their original creators.”
