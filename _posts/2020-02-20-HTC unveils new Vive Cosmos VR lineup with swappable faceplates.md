HTC is expanding its range of virtual reality headsets today with multiple new variants of the Vive Cosmos. The original Cosmos launched last year as a $699 high-end PC-powered system that used inside-out tracking and promised the ability to swap out removable faceplates. And it's a few new faceplates that are enabling the updated Cosmos lineup, with the headset itself remaining unchanged.
