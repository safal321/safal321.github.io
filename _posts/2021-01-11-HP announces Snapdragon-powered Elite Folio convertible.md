HP has announced the Elite Folio, a new convertible laptop with an Arm CPU. Like 2019's Spectre Folio, this device has a design that lets you pull the screen forward to rest between the keys and the trackpad for media consumption or touch-first work, or it can lie flat on top of the bottom shell for tablet-style use.
