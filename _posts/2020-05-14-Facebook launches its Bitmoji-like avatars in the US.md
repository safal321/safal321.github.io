Facebook is now rolling out its customizable avatars in the US after first launching them internationally last year. Like Bitmoji or Apple's Memoji, avatars offer a way to express yourself through a virtual lookalike (or whatever character you feel like creating). They can be used “in comments, stories, Messenger — and soon text posts with backgrounds,” according to Facebook's Fidji Simo. They can also be displayed on your Facebook gaming profile.
