A small group of Tesla employees and community organizers are holding a rally on Friday in the parking lot of the company's Fremont, California car factory on June 19th, or Juneteenth, the holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. The people behind the protest want Tesla employees and people from the community to “Stand with Tesla Workers for Black Lives,” according to a Facebook event. Some of them also want to push CEO Elon Musk into making a public statement, according to Protocol.
