Dyson today unveiled the Corrale, the latest product in its hair care collection. The Corrale is a cordless hair straightener that features a flexible copper plate designed to hold the hair firmly between the clamp and evenly distribute heat. While previous Dyson hair products like the Supersonic and Airwrap focused on drying the hair, the Corrale is meant to be used on already dry hair to smooth, straighten, and style.
