Spotify now supports video podcasts, starting with a handful of shows that can be viewed by most free and premium users. The company announced the news today, saying that all users where podcasts are supported will be able to not only listen to these shows but also watch them, both on desktop and mobile. For now, though, only certain podcasts are able to post video to Spotify; most podcasters won't be able to upload their own video footage. Videos will start automatically when someone presses play, and they'll sync with the audio feed, so if someone exits the app or locks their device while watching, the audio will continue.
