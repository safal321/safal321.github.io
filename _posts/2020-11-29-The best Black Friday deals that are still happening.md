Black Friday is here. You know the deal: it's the biggest shopping day of the year, followed closely by Cyber Monday, which is happening first thing next week. As you're expecting, there are some great deals on tech, including TVs, laptops, gadgets, video games, and much more â€” we have it all below. Unlike most years, the ongoing pandemic saw retailers releasing some of their best Black Friday deals earlier than ever, giving shoppers more opportunities to snag gifts. With that, a few deals might look a little familiar, but we've aimed to put in just as many brand-new deals that are hitting for the first time.
