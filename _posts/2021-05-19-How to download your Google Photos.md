As of June 1st, 2021, all of the new images and videos that you save to Google Photos will count toward your free 15GB of storage. If you don't take a lot of photos, that may not be much of a problem. And if you own a Pixel phone, your photos still won't count against your total storage. (However, be aware that those photos will be Google's “high-quality” compressed images, not the originals.) But if you like to take a good number of photos, be prepared to have to pay for Google One storage.
