Acer announced the Chromebook Spin 713 last month, and it's already $100 off at Best Buy. Its normal price is set at $629, though it's now $529. There are a few reasons you might want to consider this one over the countless other affordable options as well as some of the pricier models. First off, it has a 3:2 aspect ratio display, which affords extra vertical space so you can see more content on the screen without scrolling. It looks less cramped than 16:9, the aspect ratio used on most laptops.
