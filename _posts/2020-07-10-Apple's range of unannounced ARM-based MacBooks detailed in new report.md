Apple's first Macs based on its own ARM-based silicon will include a new MacBook Air, as well as MacBook Pros with 13.3-, 14-, and 16-inch screen sizes, according to a new report from reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The research note was reported by 9to5Mac and MacRumors. Apple officially confirmed the long-standing rumors of a switch to its own processors at WWDC last month, which will see it move away from the Intel chips it's been using for over a decade.
