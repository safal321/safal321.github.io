Microsoft is updating its $1,499 ARM-based Surface Pro X device today. The big new additions are an updated SQ2 processor, and a classic platinum color option found on Microsoft's other Surface devices. The updated processor should improve performance across a variety of apps, and Microsoft is also promising up to 15 hours of battery life.
