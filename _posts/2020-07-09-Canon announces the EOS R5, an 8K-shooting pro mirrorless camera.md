Canon has announced the EOS R5, by far the highest-end mirrorless camera it's ever made. Following Canon's solid entry into full-frame mirrorless with 2018's EOS R and last year's cheaper EOS RP, the R5 is a serious pro-level flagship with a price tag to match. At $3,899 without a lens, this is now Canon's second most expensive camera behind the new 1D X Mark III DSLR.
