Apple's second-generation AirPods that come with a wireless charging case are down to their cheapest price ever at Amazon. Normally $199, they're just $140 right now. The previous best price was holding steady at $169, so this is a great time to invest. Interestingly, these are the same price as the model that doesn't include a charging case that supports Qi chargers.
