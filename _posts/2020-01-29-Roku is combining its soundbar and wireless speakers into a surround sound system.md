Roku is doing the obvious thing: it's creating a surround sound system that brings together the company's Smart Soundbar, subwoofer, and Roku TV Wireless speakers for a more immersive audio experience. A software update, due in February, will allow owners of the Roku-branded soundbar to add the wireless speakers — previously only compatible with Roku TVs — and subwoofer to the mix. Roku uses Dolby audio (Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus), which is widely supported across Disney+, the Apple TV app, Netflix, and other streaming apps.
