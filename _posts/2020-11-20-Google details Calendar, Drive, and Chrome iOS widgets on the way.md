Google has detailed a handful of new iOS widgets it has on the way, following the launch of its new Gmail widget this week. In a blog post, the company says it's adding widgets for Drive and Google Fit, which appear to be available now, and that it has a Calendar widget planned to launch “in the coming weeks.” A widget for Chrome is due to officially launch next year and is available in beta now.
