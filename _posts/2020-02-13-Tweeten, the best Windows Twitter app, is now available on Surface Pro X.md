Twitter has abandoned its native apps for Windows, which has left a big gap for developers to try to fill. One of the most popular is Tweeten, and it's getting an update today that will support ARM-powered devices like the Surface Pro X. Tweeten is based on TweetDeck, and it offers the same column-based interface with some interface improvements and the ability to pick emoji, download GIFs, and more.
