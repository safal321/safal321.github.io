Some weeks aren't so great on the tech deals front. Thankfully, this hasn't been one of those weeks. Each day, our deals roundups have been full of fresh discounts, like the best-ever price on Amazon's new Echo Show 10 smart display that can rotate to follow your movements around the room or $100 off a 27-inch 1440p gaming monitor from LG. There are a few other deals to look through below, and they're all good, so I won't waste much more of your time. But in case you're looking for a Mother's Day gift, our gift guide (which is gorgeous, might I say) is full of ideas.
