According to a Vice report, some Amazon delivery drivers are instructed by their employers to turn off Amazon's safe driving monitoring app, so they can drive faster and get their deliveries done. The drivers don't work for Amazon directly, but instead for companies known as Delivery Service Partners, and they report that their managers or dispatchers ask them to turn off Amazon's Mentor app after leaving it running long enough to get a good score.
