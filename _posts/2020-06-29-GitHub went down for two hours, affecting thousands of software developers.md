GitHub went down for thousands of software developers this morning. The Microsoft-owned service, which provides version control via Git and hosting for software development, experienced issues for more than two hours. GitHub users experienced errors logging into the service, and some were even unable to use their integrated development environment (IDE) due to how closely linked software development is to the service.
