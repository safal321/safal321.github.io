A new Oculus Quest feature expands the headset's Guardian mode by letting you mark your real couch as an object that'll show up in VR. The Guardian is an Oculus safety feature that lets you draw lines around your environment that act as a virtual boundary and appear in VR when you get too close to the edges; this couch mode is the first time that the Guardian has worked as more than just a simple measure of floor space.
