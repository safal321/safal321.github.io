At Woot, Amazon Prime members can pick up a set of Samsung's very good Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds for $95. This is the lowest price yet. If you don't have Prime, your checkout price will be $100, so it's not too harsh of a penalty. This sale is happening for one day only, so don't expect it to be available if you're checking this out on Sunday or beyond.
