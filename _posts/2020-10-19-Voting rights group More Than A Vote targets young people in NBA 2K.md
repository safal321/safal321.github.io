Video games are popular among young people, which is why voting rights group More Than A Vote has decided to meet them where they are and create a two-part series about voting inside NBA 2K21 — and it drops today, as first reported by Axios. (I should note here that video games are also popular among people who aren't young.) The episodes were produced by The SpringHill Company, LeBron James' production company, and they will play on “2KTV,” the show inside the game.
