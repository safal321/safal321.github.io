Samsung's One UI 3.0 update, which incorporates Android 11's new features alongside some Samsung-specific improvements, has started rolling out in public beta in the US, SamMobile reports. The software is reportedly available for the T-Mobile variants of Samsung's Galaxy S20 lineup, including the standard S20, S20 Plus, and S20 Ultra, though the rollout should expand in the hours and days ahead. If you've got a supported device, you can enroll in the beta via the Samsung Members app.
