Initially, Your Progress Will Be Saved feels like something you'd find in a modern art gallery. Attendees start off in a sort of holding area, a dimly lit room with a clean, minimalist aesthetic. A flight of stairs takes you to a broken mirror resting on a pedestal, with a description of the mirror emoji pasted on the wall behind it. But things get strange when you turn around. In order to move forward, you have to walk right through a glowing blue wall into a completely new location. This is art by way of Fortnite.
