HMD is announcing six new midrange devices today led by the Nokia X20, a midrange handset priced starting at xe2x82xac349 / xc2xa3299.99 (around $415). It will release in “select markets globally” such as the UK starting next month, but we're still waiting on HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability. I've been using the phone running near-final software over the past week, which has been enough to get some rough first impressions about the device.
