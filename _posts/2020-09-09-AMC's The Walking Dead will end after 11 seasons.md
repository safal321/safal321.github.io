The Walking Dead television series on AMC that debuted nearly 10 years ago will end after 11 seasons. That might be bleak news for fans, but there will be plenty of episodes to watch before it all comes to an end. Variety and Entertainment Weekly both report that the final season will consist of 24 episodes debuting in late 2021. Between now and then, fans will be treated to seven episodes for the 10th season, one of which is the finale airing on October 4th, followed by six bonus episodes airing in early 2021.
