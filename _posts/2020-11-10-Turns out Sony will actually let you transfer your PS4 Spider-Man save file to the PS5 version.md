If you own a copy of Spider-Man on the PS4 and you planned to buy a PS5 in the near future, you will likely be glad to know that your PS4 save file will be transferrable after all. Insomniac Games announced today that a new update will arrive for the PS4 version later this month, allowing you to export your saves to the next-gen remaster.
