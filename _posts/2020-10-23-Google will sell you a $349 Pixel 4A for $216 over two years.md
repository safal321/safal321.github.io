You can now buy the Pixel 4A from Google for just $9 per month over 24 months as part of the new Google Fi phone subscription program. That monthly cost means you'd pay just just $216 for the phone, a substantial savings over its $349 upfront price. After you've made all 24 payments, you own the phone.
