Oculus is beginning to roll out redesigned avatars that are more expressive and customizable than those that launched in 2016. They'll appear starting today in just a few games for the Quest VR platform, including Epic Roller Coasters, PokerStarsVR, and Topgolf with Pro Putt. Soon, they'll appear in Synth Riders, and later in the year, a new game called ForeVR Bowling will feature them.
