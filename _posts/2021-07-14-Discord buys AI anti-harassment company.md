Discord has purchased a company working on AI tools to detect harassment online. The company, Sentropy, monitors online networks for abuse and harassment, then offers users a way to block problematic people and filter out messages they don't want to see. Its first product, Sentropy Protect, was initially focused on helping users clean up their Twitter feeds.
