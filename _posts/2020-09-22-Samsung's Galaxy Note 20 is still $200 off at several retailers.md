If it's time to upgrade your phone, you might be considering Samsung's Galaxy Note 20 or the Note 20 Ultra. Both are among the most powerful Android phones around, with the Note 20 Ultra being particularly crammed with better specs than most other devices. And currently, both phones are available unlocked for $200 less than they usually cost. It's been a few weeks since we last surfaced this deal, and it's still happening all across the web, including on eBay (via Microsoft), Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.
