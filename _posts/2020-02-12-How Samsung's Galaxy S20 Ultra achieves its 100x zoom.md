Samsung's newly announced Galaxy S20 Ultra offers a new feature that the company is calling “Space Zoom,” which allows its cameras to offer a total combined optical and digital zoom of 100x. That sounds like one of the biggest zooms we've seen on a mainstream smartphone, but there's a lot of nuance to how Samsung's phone achieves the figure. In short, it's all down to a combination of optical zooming hardware, image processing, and an exceptionally high-resolution sensor.
