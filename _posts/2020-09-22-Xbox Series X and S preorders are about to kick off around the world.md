Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Series S consoles will be available for preorder around the world on September 22nd â€” and depending on where you live, that's happening very soon. If you're reading this in New Zealand, you'll be able to place an order in just under two hours, with the wait being just a bit longer for those in Australia. By the time those on the US East Coast wake up, gamers in the UK and Europe will have already put money down on a new console. Those preorders start at 8AM BST (3AM ET) and 9AM, respectively.
