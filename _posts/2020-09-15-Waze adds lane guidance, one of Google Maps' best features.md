Waze is finally adding one of the handiest features from Google Maps and Apple Maps: lane guidance. The feature, now out of beta on the Google-owned navigation app, recommends what lane you should be in when you're entering or exiting a freeway, for instance. It's also helpful when navigating complicated intersections or highway mergers.
