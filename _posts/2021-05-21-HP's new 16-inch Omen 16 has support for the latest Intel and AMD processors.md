HP made an almost overwhelming bunch of gaming announcements today, which include systems equipped with Intel's 11th Gen H-series processors: a new 16-inch Omen gaming laptop and an updated 17-inch version, along with a new budget-friendly gaming laptop line called Victus. There is also a new Nvidia G-Sync-compatible monitor. Other major tech companies — such as Razer, Lenovo, MSI, and Asus — debuted their H-series-equipped laptops last week, but HP saved its news for now.
