Sony's high-end 1000XM3 earbuds offer noise cancellation and some of the best audio quality you'll find in a truly wireless set, but today, the company is announcing a significantly less expensive option: the new WF-XB700 earbuds. Priced at only $129.99, the XB700s feature Sony's signature “Extra Bass” technology for punchier sound output. At that price, Sony is undercutting competitors like Jabra and Samsung.
