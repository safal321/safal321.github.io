Images and details of VanMoof's new Electrified S3 and X3 e-bikes have leaked ahead of the April 21st announcement. The company's third-generation electric bikes have been overhauled with new brakes, a new saddle, improved electronic shifting, and an updated front-hub motor. But the biggest news might be the price: $1,998 / xe2x82xac1,998 for either the full-sized S3 or compact X3.
