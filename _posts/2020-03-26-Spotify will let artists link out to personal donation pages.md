Spotify's always billed itself as a platform for creators, so today, it announced that it's going to help artists in need. The company will allow creators to link out to donation pages, whether it's their own, a friend's, or just an organization's. Spotify won't take a cut of the proceeds, and artists can opt into the feature when it eventually launches, which the company says will be “soon.” Interested artists can preemptively sign up here.
