Shopping for a new set of wireless headphones can be a difficult and expensive journey. That's not the case for today, as Amazon is selling the Beats Solo Pro for $70 off their usual price. Normally $300, they're $230 in a wide range of colors, covering people who want a vibrant look or a muted one. These are Beats' latest on-ear model, and they are packed with features, like active noise cancellation to silence distractions, a transparency mode to let you quickly hear what's around you, and Apple's H1 wireless chip, which grants enhanced wireless range and hands-free controls with “Hey Siri” support.
