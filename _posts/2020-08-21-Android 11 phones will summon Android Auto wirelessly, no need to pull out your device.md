Apple CarPlay and Google's Android Auto both seem pretty useful for drivers — simply plug in your phone to charge, and it'll link up with your car's bigger touchscreen to give you directions to your doctor's appointment, play music from your Spotify playlist, or send a text. Google also has an easier version that lets you connect wirelessly to your car stereo without even taking your phone out of your pocket — but it was limited to Google and Samsung phones. Now, Google has quietly announced that any phone running Android 11 will be able to connect to Android Auto, cable-free.
