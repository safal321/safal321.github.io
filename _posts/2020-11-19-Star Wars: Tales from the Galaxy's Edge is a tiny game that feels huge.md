I've avoided many of 2020's big games because they're simply too big. Titles like Watch Dogs: Legion and Ghost of Tsushima, with their huge maps and endless quest lists, feel like part-time jobs. But while I appreciate my freed-up nights and weekends, I miss the specific cadence of open-world action games: that distinctive combination of pitched fights and methodical, low-stakes scavenging. And the new virtual reality game Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge comes surprisingly close to offering a compromise â€” or it would, if there were more of it.
