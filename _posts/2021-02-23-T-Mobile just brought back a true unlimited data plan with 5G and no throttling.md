T-Mobile has just announced a new monthly phone plan called Magenta Max that the company says is designed for the era of 5G. According to this press release, T-Mobile claims Magenta Max is “the first and only 5G consumer smartphone plan that can't slow you down based on how much data you use.” That makes it sound like the carrier is doing away with what's known as deprioritization, where your speeds are subject to slowdown after you exceed a certain amount of data in a billing cycle.
