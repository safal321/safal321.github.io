Apple Music is getting two big updates next month: support for high-quality lossless audio and for spatial audio through Dolby Atmos. But even more surprising: the features will be available for free to all subscribers. The company says it'll have 75 million lossless audio songs in its catalog to start, and anyone listening through AirPods or Beats that use the H1 or W1 chip or the built-in speakers in the latest versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac will have spatial audio turned on by default.
