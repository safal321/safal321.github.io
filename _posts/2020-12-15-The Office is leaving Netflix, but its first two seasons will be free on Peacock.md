The end of an era is approaching: The Office will leave Netflix on January 1st and exclusively move over to Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service. Peacock confirmed the January 1st launch date today and explained how viewers can watch all 201 episodes of the show. The first two seasons will be available for free, but seasons 3 through 9 will require a paid subscription. Viewers can either pay $4.99 per month with ads or $9.99 monthly without ads.
