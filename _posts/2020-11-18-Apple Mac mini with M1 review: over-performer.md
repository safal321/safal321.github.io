The Mac mini has always been Apple's most flexible desktop computer. Sure, most people go for the traditional experience and plug in a display, mouse, and keyboard â€” but you can also have it serve as a home theater PC, or put it to work with professional photo or audio editing, or turn a group of minis into a server farm. Apple opened new possibilities for the mini with the big upgrade it got in 2018, and two years later, it's one of the first three Macs to transition away from Intel processors and showcase the potential of Apple silicon and the M1 chip. (It's also worth noting that Apple was using the mini as its early Arm test unit for developers, so the company was already partway to a consumer product.)
