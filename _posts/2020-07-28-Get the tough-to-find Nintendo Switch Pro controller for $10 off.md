Nintendo's Switch Pro controller is one of my favorites ever, but there are two things that I don't like about it: it's kind of expensive, and it's usually hard to find. For a limited time, Amazon is solving both problems by selling its stock for $60 each, which is $10 off its usual price. Get this controller if you want excellent battery life, a comfortable grip, and compatibility with Windows 10 via its Bluetooth feature. It'll likely be extremely tough to find as we inch toward the holidays.
