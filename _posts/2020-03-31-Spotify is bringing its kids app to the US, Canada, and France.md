Spotify's expanding the rollout of its kids app, just as more kids are at home with nothing to do. The company announced that it's bringing Spotify Kids to the US, Canada, and France today. The ad-free iOS / Android app is only available to Spotify Premium Family subscribers and features content appropriate for kids ages three and older. Spotify first launched the app in Ireland in October, and since then, it's made multiple product adjustments, although the app is still considered to be in beta.
