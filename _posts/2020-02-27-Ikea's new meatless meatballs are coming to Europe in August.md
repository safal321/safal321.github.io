Ikea's plant-based meatballs will be available in its roughly 290 European stores starting this August, the company has confirmed to The Verge, with other markets set to follow a couple of months later. The so-called “plant ball,” which may or may not be the name on the menu, is designed to both look and taste like meat, but it's made out of a combination of pea protein, oats, apples, and potatoes. Ikea says the plant ball has a climate footprint that's 96-percent smaller than its traditional pork-and-beef meatballs. Last year Ikea sold over 1 billion meatballs.
