A one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus normally costs $60, but it's available for almost half that price at CDKeys.com. You'll need this service to play PS4 games online right now, and it's an especially good deal if you're planning to upgrade to the PS5 this year. On the new console, this subscription will grant you access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, a suite of several acclaimed PS4 classics (including Persona 5, Bloodborne, God of War, and more) that will be available for you to download a la Xbox Game Pass.
