After the success of its Disney Plus series WandaVision, Marvel has gone back to press for new print runs of several WandaVision-related titles, Entertainment Weekly reported. Scarlet Witch by James Robinson; Steve Englehart's Vision and Scarlet Witch, and Vision, by Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta are all on the list. Marvel also will be increasing its stock of print issues of House of M, which EW says ran out “almost overnight” after the show debuted in January.
