There isn't much about the new HP Omen 27i that I haven't seen before in a gaming monitor, but it's packed full of specs that HP hasn't offered until now. The 27-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) nano IPS display offers far better color accuracy and contrast than the TN panels used in many of HP's previous gaming monitors.
