GoPro is laying off more than 20 percent of its workforce, over 200 employees, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has announced. The move is part of an attempt to reduce operating expenses by $100 million the year, on top of another $250 million in non-headcount related expense reductions planned for 2021. GoPro added that its founder and CEO, Nicholas Woodman, will not be paid a salary for the remainder of the year, and that the company will shift more towards a direct-to-consumer sales model going forward.
