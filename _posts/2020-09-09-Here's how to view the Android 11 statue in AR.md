Google has officially announced Android 11, and the new operating system is already rolling out to Pixel phones. In honor of the release, Google has created a statue that you can view in augmented reality on any Android phone. Dave Burke, Android's VP of engineering, tweeted a picture of the virtual statue earlier this afternoon.
