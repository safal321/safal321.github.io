It may be time to pour one out for the streaming service trial. CNET reports that HBO Max is no longer offering users a free week of watching its content, following both Disney Plus and Netflix's examples earlier in the year. This change, probably not coincidentally, comes just weeks before December 25th, when Wonder Woman 1984 is set to launch on the service (as well as in theaters, but you should probably stay home). While it can't compete with free, the $14.99 you'll now have to pay to see the movie still compares favorably to the price of a theater ticket (and it's a month of entertainment as opposed to two-ish hours).
