OnePlus has announced its first fitness tracker, the OnePlus Band, featuring heart rate and blood oxygen saturation monitors, fitness and sleep tracking, and a battery life of up to two weeks. It works with Android at launch but not iOS; OnePlus says compatibility with iPhones will be added later.  The OnePlus Band will be available in India starting January 13th for xe2x82xb92,499 (around $34), but a global release is yet to be announced.
