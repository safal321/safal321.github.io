John Legere has formally cut ties with T-Mobile US, the company he led as CEO for over seven years. After steering T-Mobile through a dramatic turnaround that culminated in its successful merger with former rival Sprint, Legere stepped down and Mike Sievert was appointed T-Mobile's new chief executive earlier this month. At that time, Legere had said he would remain on T-Mobile's board of directors until June 4th.
