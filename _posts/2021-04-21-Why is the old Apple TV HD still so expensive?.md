Apple refreshed its Apple TV 4K streaming box today with upgraded specs and, perhaps most importantly, a redesigned, simpler Siri remote. When the new device ships in late May, it'll cost the same price as before: $179 for a 32GB unit or $199 for 64GB. (Sidenote: I've yet to meet anyone who has needed the higher storage option on any Apple TV.)
