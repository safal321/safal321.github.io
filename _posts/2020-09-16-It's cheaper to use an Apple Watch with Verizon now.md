If you were thinking of adding a new Apple Watch (or any other LTE-ready smartwatch with a dedicated phone number) to your Verizon account, you'll probably like to hear that the carrier just cut the monthly cost of doing that by half. It's normally $20 to add a watch if you don't already have a phone on your account, though it will now costs $10 per month per watch for all standalone plans. Pricing for subscribers who have both a phone and a watch on their accounts is unchanged.
