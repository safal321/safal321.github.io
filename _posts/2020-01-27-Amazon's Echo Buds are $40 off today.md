Amazon's Echo Buds are on sale for $90, in what appears to be their first sale since launching in October. The wireless earbuds normally sell for $130, which is a steep price considering you can get Apple's much-loved AirPods for $159. With this discount, the Echo Buds are competing in a very different price class and look like a far better value.
