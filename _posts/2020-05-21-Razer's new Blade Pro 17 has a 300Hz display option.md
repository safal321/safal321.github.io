Razer has announced the 2020 version of its Blade Pro 17. Like last year's model, there is a 4K 120Hz touch display option for creative professionals. But Razer has upgraded the gaming-focused display option to a 300Hz 1080p panel. Razer says the 4K screen will cover 100 percent of the Adobe RGB space, and the 1080p display comes with a glare-reducing matte finish.
