Don't expect to see a OnePlus 8T Pro announced alongside the standard OnePlus 8T next month, Android Authority reports. OnePlus CEO Pete Lau (or Liu Zuohu as he's known in China) confirmed the news via a post on Weibo, in which he said anyone looking for a Pro device can continue to buy the OnePlus 8 Pro released earlier this year. However, Lau added that the company still has some surprises in store during its One Plus 8T reveal, scheduled for October 14th.
