Fitbit Coach and Fitbit Premium are the company's fitness subscription memberships that offer guided health programs from the app / wearable device. Fitbit first came out with its Fitbit Coach program for guided exercises such as HIIT training or body weight workouts, then followed up with a Fitbit Premium program last summer. This latest program offers wellness reports, meditation programs, and other health coaching for improved eating and sleep habits.
