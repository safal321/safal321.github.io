Two unlikely podcasting networks — NPR and Spotify — are teaming up. The companies announced a new distribution deal today that'll bring select NPR programs, like Planet Money, TED Radio Hour, and Invisibilia to Spotify's global audience. NPR first brought its shows to Spotify in 2018, but only for US audiences because of various regulations and country-specific licensing structures. Now it's able to distribute those shows globally, although the details of the new arrangement remain unclear. The companies won't be sharing revenue or jointly selling ads from this broader distribution deal, but they both have committed to respective marketing pushes.
