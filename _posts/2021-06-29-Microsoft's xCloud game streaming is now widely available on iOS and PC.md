Microsoft's xCloud, the cloud game streaming component of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate that doesn't require a console to use, is rolling out fully to iOS devices, including iPhones and iPads, as well as PCs and macOS computers via the web. It's been in an invite-only beta period since mid-April 2021, but Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now access games right from their devices.
