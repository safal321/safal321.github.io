Today's best deals include all sorts of tech at different price ranges, including noise-canceling headphones, e-readers, gaming laptops, and even a 4K TV with Mini-LED backlighting. Starting with headphones, we're seeing a big price drop on the Bang & Olufsen H9i wireless over-ear headphones with active noise cancellation. Normally retailing on Amazon at $500 (or around $300 if you buy from a third-party seller), they're currently sitting at $200 â€” the single biggest price cut yet.
