The Lightning Deal for Acer's 27-inch 4K Predator gaming monitor at Amazon lasted about 10 seconds. For a brief flash of time, it dropped from its usual $1,200 price to $720. The deal was supposed to last until tonight 11:45PM PT / 2:45AM ET, but that clearly didn't happen. This monitor has swung down to $900 a few times, but this was the best deal yet.
