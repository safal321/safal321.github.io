Twitter provided an update about the unprecedented July 15th attack that allowed hackers to tweet from some of the most high-profile accounts on the service, in a blog post and a series of tweets published Thursday evening. Twitter now says that a few employees were targeted in a phone spear phishing attack. While Twitter doesn't quite say, that presumably means hackers called up Twitter employees while posing as colleagues or members of Twitter's own security team, and got them to reveal the credentials they use to access internal systems.
