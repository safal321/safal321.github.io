On Tuesday night, musician Marc Rebillet live-streamed on Twitch, looping layers of piano while crooning over the top to create a jazzy, lo-fi track on the fly. Any other day, this would have been a usual performance for Rebillet, who is known for recording his solo sets. But Rebillet wasn't supposed to be at home on Tuesday night; he was supposed to be performing in Australia. Like many other musicians, his tour was suddenly canceled as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Now, he's stuck at home, hoping Twitch can mitigate the financial damage from canceled shows. “I'm just trying to survive,” he says, “and Twitch has the highest earning potential for livestreams.”
