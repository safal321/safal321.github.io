Zendure's SuperTank power bank is $100 at Wellbots today, which is the lowest price we've seen that doesn't require a coupon code. It will ship for free and is a tax-free purchase for people who live outside of New York state, as well. This battery's best feature is that it can recharge devices requiring up to 100W (this includes the 16-inch MacBook Pro, among other powerful machines) at the same speedy pace that their factory chargers can deliver, yet it's smaller and more portable.
