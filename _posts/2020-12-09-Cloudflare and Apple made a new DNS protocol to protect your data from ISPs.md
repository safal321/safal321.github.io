Cloudflare is proposing a new DNS standard it developed with Apple that's designed to help close a blindspot in my (and I'm sure many others') internet privacy measures (via TechCrunch). The protocol is called Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH), and it's meant to help anonymize the information that's sent before you even make it onto a website. Whether that will help you with your overall net privacy is something we'll tackle in a second, but first, we need to understand how regular DNS works, and what Cloudflare has added.
