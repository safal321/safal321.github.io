iHeartMedia, the radio station company that's pushed into podcasts, is now getting into the books business. The company announced yesterday that its Stuff You Should Know podcast series has signed a four-book deal with Flatiron Books. The first book, Stuff You Should Know: An Incomplete Compendium of Mostly Interesting Things, will be released this fall and will “answer all the questions readers didn't know they wanted to ask.” Start thinking of those questions!
