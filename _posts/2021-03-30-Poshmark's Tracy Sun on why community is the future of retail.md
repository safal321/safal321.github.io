E-commerce has seen a huge wave of growth during the pandemic, and my guest on today's Decoder has gained experience riding this wave. Tracy Sun is the co-founder and SVP of new markets at Poshmark, a fashion resale company that just went public earlier this year. The Poshmark app is a different kind of riff on e-commerce, though â€” it's part catalog, part social network, and part creator platform. It competes with similar apps like Depop and Etsy, but also things like Instagram and eBay.
