San Diego Comic-Con has just announced this year's show will not go on, at least not in person. For the second time in 50 years — the first was last year — Comic-Con has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There'll still be a virtual event from July 23rd to the 25th, and organizers are planning a three-day in-person convention tentatively set for November, but they're clear that the full shebang has been postponed until 2022 — and offering refunds and rollovers as appropriate.
