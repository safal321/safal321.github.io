There's a new Nokia-branded Android TV box on its way to Europe, according to Golem.de. The Streaming Box 8000 is the work of Streamview, and its website notes it has licensed the Nokia brand to sell Smart TVs, set-top boxes, and DAB+ radios across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The streaming box reportedly supports 4K playback, costs xe2x82xac100, and will be available later this year â€” though an exact release date and countries have yet to be confirmed.
