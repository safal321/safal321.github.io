The heir-apparent to the Samsung Group, Lee Jae-yong (or Jay Y. Lee in the Western construction), has apologized for his role in a succession plot that resulted in a bribery conviction, and for executives caught sabotaging attempts to organize labor at the company. Lee, the only son of the incapacitated Chairman Lee Kun-hee and grandson of founder Lee Byung-chull, also pledged that he would not pass management control of the Korean dynasty to his children.
