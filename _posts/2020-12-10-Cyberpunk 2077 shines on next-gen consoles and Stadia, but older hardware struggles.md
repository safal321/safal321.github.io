Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just one of the biggest games of the year; it's also one of the most technically demanding. CD Projekt Red's ambitious roleplaying game takes place in a huge, dense open world, and — as anyone who has ever played a Bethesda game can attest to — technology is often a step behind the designers in these kinds of experiences. Glitches and bugs are not uncommon occurrences, and early demos are far cries from what the game may look like on the standard hardware most players have in their living room.
