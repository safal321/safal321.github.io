Bose is ready to reenter the competitive true wireless earbuds market with two new products. Today, the company is announcing both the noise-canceling QuietComfort Earbuds, priced at $279, and the $179 Sports Earbuds. (They were previously known as the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 and 500, respectively.) With the flagship QuietComfort Earbuds, Bose is promising to deliver “all the ‘quiet' of Bose around-ear headphones” in a truly wireless form factor. As for the Sports Earbuds, essentially a successor to 2017's SoundSport Free, Bose says they're designed for comfort and stability through even the most vigorous, intense workouts. Both will be available on September 29th, with preorders starting today.
