The HyperX new Cloud II Wireless headset is made for people who want simple controls, barely-there comfort, and solid sound quality. This model is just a wire-free version of the company's $100 flagship Cloud II gaming headset. It uses a 2.4GHz wireless receiver that works with PCs, the PS4 — and likely the PS5, when that is released in November — and the Nintendo Switch (via its dock). I've also successfully connected it to a 2019 MacBook Pro through a USB-C to USB-A adapter. The $149.99 headset is available for order through HyperX starting on November 10th.
