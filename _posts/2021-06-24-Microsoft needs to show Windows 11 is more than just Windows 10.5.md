Microsoft is about to unveil Windows 11 this morning, the company's next major operating system. While a leak of Windows 11 has provided an early look at some of the design changes, I'm expecting to see a lot more today. A new Start menu, rounded corners, and a general UI overhaul have been expected for months, but Microsoft will need to show some big changes to Windows 11 to prove it's more than just Windows 10 with a paint job.
