Google's Stadia Controller will finally work wirelessly with laptops and desktops starting this week, the company announced today (via Engadget). Since the cloud gaming service's November launch, the only way you could use your controller wirelessly was if you were playing Stadia on your TV with a Chromecast Ultra. You still can't use the Stadia Controller wirelessly with an Android phone, though, and it's not clear when that functionality might arrive.
