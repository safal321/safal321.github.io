Tinder is going to launch its own in-app, one-on-one video chats later this year. Match Group, the brand's parent company, announced the feature in its earnings release today. Details are scarce, but the fact that Tinder is even going to release this feature is big news. This would be one of the largest feature introductions for the brand, and an especially impressive undertaking considering Tinder has millions of users, and video calls can be places ripe for abuse. The company couldn't share additional details with The Verge.
