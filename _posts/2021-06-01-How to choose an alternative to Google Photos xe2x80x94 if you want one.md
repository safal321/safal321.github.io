Last November, Google — which had offered unlimited storage for what it called “high quality” (read: compressed) photos — announced that, as of June 1st, “unlimited” was being changed to “up to 15GB on your Google account.” (Oh, and “high quality” is being renamed “storage saver.”) In other words, while photo and video storage once did not count against your total of 15 free gigs on a Google account, it does now — along with your Gmail, Google Drive files, and other stored data. Once you hit that 15GB wall, you will have to buy into the Google One service to increase your storage capacity. (Unless you own a Pixel 5 or earlier device, in which case you still have no limits on “high quality” photos.)
