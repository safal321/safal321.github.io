Kobo is introducing a new entry-level e-reader to its lineup, the $99.99 Nia, which slots in beneath the $119.99 Clara HD model (which is sticking around). While both models have a 6-inch display, the Nia's $20 savings come with slightly worse specs in a few areas compared to its slightly pricier sibling.
