Lenovo's Tab P11 Pro is the company's top-tier Android tablet. With an 11-inch OLED screen, quad speakers, and snap-on keyboard, it's meant to go head to head with Samsung's Tab S7 and Apple's iPad Air. But while the Tab P11 Pro is excellent for watching movies — that OLED screen and the Dolby Atmos speakers are quite nice — it's considerably less impressive when you attempt to use it for productivity.
