Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and musician Jay-Z have pledged 500 bitcoin (around $23.3 million) toward xe2x82xbftrust, an endowment to fund bitcoin development, Dorsey announced on Twitter today. The CEO said development will initially be focused on teams in Africa and India, but that he and Jay-Z plan to give “zero direction” to the plans. xe2x82xbftrust is currently looking for three board members, with an application form noting its mission is to “make bitcoin the internet's currency.”
