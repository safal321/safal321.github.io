The incredibly lightweight Eeyo 1S electric bike is certainly fun to ride, as I said in my review, but it's not very practical for most city commuters. Not only is it expensive at $4,599, its unique diamond-frame design eschews both front and rear fenders â€” you can't even buy them as accessories from Gogoro. While the resulting look is sleek and desirable, it also means arriving at your destination splattered in road grime whenever it rains.
