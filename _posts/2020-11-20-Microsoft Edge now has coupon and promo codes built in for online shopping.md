Microsoft is adding a new coupons feature to its Edge browser today. Coupons and promo codes will appear inside Edge as an alert when you're shopping online, and they can be automatically applied to a basket when you're ready to check out. The coupons feature also includes price comparisons, so if you're shopping online, Edge can surface different retailers that might offer items at lower prices.
