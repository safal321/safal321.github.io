A new tool by hacking group Unc0ver can jailbreak iOS 13.5, the just-released version of Apple's mobile operating system, Wired reported.  The group says the jailbreak, which works on iOS 11 and higher, is built on a zero-day vulnerability, doesn't drain a device's battery life, and doesn't affect the use of Apple services or undermine the iOS sandbox security, according to Wired.
