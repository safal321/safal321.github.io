If your PlayStation Plus membership is about to expire or you want to extend the subscription for another two years, Eneba is offering an exclusive deal to The Verge readers. You can purchase two one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions for only $56 when you enter the discount code VERGEFEB at checkout, while supplies last. This is a great deal â€” the usual price for one year of PlayStation Plus is $60, so purchasing two one-year subscriptions for less than the price of one is a real bargain. If you want just one year, you can buy it for $29. (No code needed.)
