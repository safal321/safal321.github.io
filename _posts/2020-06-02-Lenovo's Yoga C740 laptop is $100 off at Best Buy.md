Lenovo's C740 14-inch laptop is one of the best laptops you can buy, and it's also the most affordable option in our buying guide. Now, at Best Buy, it costs even less than usual. The standard configuration with a quad-core 10th Gen Intel Core i5-10210U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is just $600 instead of its regular $800 price. This laptop has a 2-in-1 design that lets its display flip nearly 360 degrees around, so you can use it as a tablet. It also features two USB-C ports, a USB Type-A port, and a headphone jack.
