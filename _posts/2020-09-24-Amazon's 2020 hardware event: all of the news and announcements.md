Amazon is hosting its annual hardware event on Thursday, September 24th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT, where we expect it to announce a bunch of gadgets. It won't be live-streamed, so, unfortunately, we can't all watch together. But The Verge's Dieter Bohn will be handling the live blog to cover the minute-to-minute announcements. We'll be adding all of the latest announcements and news to this post.
