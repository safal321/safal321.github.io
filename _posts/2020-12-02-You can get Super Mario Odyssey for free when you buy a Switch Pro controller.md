Just when you thought retailers had put up their best deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Walmart comes in with this excellent Switch Pro controller bundle. Priced at $70 (the regular price for this controller), you'll get a free download code for Super Mario Odyssey for the Nintendo Switch with purchase. That $60 game has so far avoided any big price cuts this holiday season, so it's great to see it included here. If you're gifting a Nintendo Switch for the holidays, this seems like the perfect pairing (just don't forget a microSD card to expand the console's paltry 32GB of storage).
