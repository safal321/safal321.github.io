D-Link is trying to make it simple to give your computer a Wi-Fi upgrade. The networking company has announced what it's calling an “industry-first” Wi-Fi 6 adapter built into a USB stick. Plug it into your laptop or desktop computer, and you may be able to get better performance than from your older Wi-Fi chip. The adapter advertises speeds up to 1,200Mbps.
