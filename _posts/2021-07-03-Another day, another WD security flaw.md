After a security vulnerability led to some WD NAS owners having their data wiped, a new vulnerability has been discovered in more of WD's devices (via KrebsOnSecurity). The vulnerability, discovered by security researchers Pedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski, is seemingly present on Cloud OS 3 devices and not on the newer Cloud OS 5, which WD recently released as an update. The problem is that, according to Ribeiro and Domanski, many of WD's users don't like the new version. That's because it's missing certain functions and features that were available in Cloud OS 3. WD has said it won't be updating Cloud OS 3 with security patches.
