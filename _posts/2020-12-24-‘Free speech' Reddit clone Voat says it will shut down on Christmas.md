Voat, an “anti-censorship” alternative social network that's been described as the “alt-right Reddit,” is scheduled to shut down on December 25th. Voat co-founder Justin Chastain announced the pending closure yesterday, saying the site had run out of money after an investor defaulted on their contract in March. “I personally decided to keep Voat up until after the US election of 2020. I've been paying the costs out of pocket but now I'm out of money,” Chastain wrote.
