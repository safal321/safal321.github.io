I have to admit that the fact that this watch is called the “Amazfit T-Rex” was a fairly major factor in my deciding to check it out. Who doesn't want to say they have a T-Rex on their wrist? A bigger factor, though, was its manufacturer's claims about the watch's battery life, and I'm surprised to confirm that the T-Rex did not disappoint.
