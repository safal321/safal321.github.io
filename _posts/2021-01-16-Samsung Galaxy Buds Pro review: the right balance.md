Let's just get to it: Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro are the best true wireless earbuds that the company has made yet.

These earbuds improve on Samsung's prior efforts with clever features like a speech detection mode that automatically lowers your music and lets you hear the outside world as soon as you start talking.
