Adobe is releasing Illustrator for the iPad today, delivering a streamlined version of its desktop vector graphics app that's been redesigned to work with touch controls and a stylus. Just about everything you'd expect from a mobile version of Illustrator is here, from the pen, pencil, and brush tools, to layers, properties, and grid options, to basics like the type tool and path options. Some more specific features are still missing, but they may not be things you need day-to-day.
