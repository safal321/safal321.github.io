Where is Google's Pixel 4A? Sitting right on the company's online store, as it turns out. Google seems to have mistakenly published an image of the Pixel 4A on its Canadian store. The text says “Nest Wifi,” but uh... that's no Nest Wifi. The phone has already leaked extensively over the last few months, but this is a marketing render direct from Google — and suggests that the 4A might finally be coming sometime in the near future.
