Dubai-based ad agency Memac Ogilvy and KFC Arabia found a way to circumvent Spotify Premium's ad-free platform: they took over the profiles of three artists from the region. The campaign, featured on Design Taxi, worked with artists Flipperachi, Moh Flow, and Shxc3xa9bani to replace their profile headers, album covers, and profile avatars with photos of KFC's new burger. The press video boasts that it was “the first campaign ever on Spotify Premium” and goes on to say, “By hacking a platform where ads are not allowed, we gave the Kentucky burger the campaign that it truly deserved.”
