Kensington's StudioDock, the high-end $399.99 desktop hub for the iPad Pro that was released earlier this year, isn't compatible with the new 12.9-inch model hitting stores today. A representative for Kensington confirmed the news to The Verge, saying it's because the new iPad Pro is 0.5mm thicker than the 2018 and 2020 models.
