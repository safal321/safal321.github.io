Lenovo is adding two new devices to its Windows 10 lineup — the Yoga Duet 7i and the IdeaPad Duet 3i — both of which are detachable 2-in-1 devices that support LTE. They both feature a design similar to Microsoft's Surface tablets but have the bonus of coming bundled with the keyboard, which, this time around, supports Bluetooth for use while detached.
