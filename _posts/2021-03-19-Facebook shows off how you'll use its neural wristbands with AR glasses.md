Facebook has offered a glimpse inside its plans for a new augmented reality interface, based on technology from CTRL-Labs, the startup it acquired in 2019. In a video, it shows off wristbands that use electromyography (EMG) to translate subtle neural signals into actions â€” like typing, swiping, or playing games like an archery simulator. The bands also offer haptic feedback, creating a system that's more responsive than basic hand tracking options.
