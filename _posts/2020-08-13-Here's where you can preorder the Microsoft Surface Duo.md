Microsoft's dual-screened Android phone, the Surface Duo, will release on September 10th, following close to a year of waiting since its reveal in 2019. It will cost $1,399, but you'll only pay that much upfront if you buy it unlocked. Otherwise, you'll owe a smaller monthly payment if you buy it on an installment plan through AT&T or Best Buy.
