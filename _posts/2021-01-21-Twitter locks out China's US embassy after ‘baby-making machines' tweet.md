Twitter has locked the official account for China's US embassy, over a tweet it said violated its policy against dehumanization, Bloomberg reports. The tweet, which was originally shared on January 7th, referred to Uighur women as “baby-making machines” prior to government intervention. Twitter removed the tweet and replaced it with a notice saying it's no longer available. However, Twitter requires account owners to manually delete tweets that violate its rules before unlocking accounts.
