Apple announced today that Apple Maps has been updated with vaccine locations from VaccineFinder, a site run by Boston Children's Hospital that provides information on vaccine eligibility and availability. People can search for nearby vaccination sites in Apple Maps or ask Siri, “Where can I get a COVID vaccination?” Over 20,000 locations are now listed, with more to be added in the coming weeks.
