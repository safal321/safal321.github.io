Many years ago, when I was studying ASL (American Sign Language), my teachers used to depend on separate devices that would hook into their TV sets to supply closed captioning â€” captioning that was limited and, to tell the truth, not very accurate. These days, almost every video (and every TV) has closed captioning available for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or who just have difficulty following the voices from the set.
