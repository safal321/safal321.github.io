Apple announced its new Magic Keyboard with trackpad for the iPad Pro last month, but the company has so far refused to reveal the weight of the accessory that's now shipping to customers. We finally have an answer, thanks to a MacRumors forum poster (via 9to5Mac) who received a Magic Keyboard over the weekend. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard weigh in at 3 pounds (1362 grams), more than the 2.8 pounds (1290 grams) of the 13-inch MacBook Air but the same as the 13-inch MacBook Pro.
