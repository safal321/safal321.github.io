If you missed out on Woot's deal a few weeks ago that offered refurbished Kindle Oasis e-readers for $100, there's another good deal happening today. The last-gen version of the Oasis is once again available, but it's new with special offers (Amazon's lock screen ads) and costs $170. For context, a new Oasis costs $250. As for what's different between the current model and this one, you'll miss out on a screen that can adapt its color temperature to your environment. But you'll still get a waterproof e-reader that feels more like a book to use than other models, says my colleague Chaim Gartenberg.
