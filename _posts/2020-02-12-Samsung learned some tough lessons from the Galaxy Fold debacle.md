Samsung didn't waste any time unveiling its latest foldable Galaxy Z Flip phone during the company's Unpacked event on February 11th. It was the opening act, a stark contrast to last year's Galaxy Note 10 launch when the Galaxy Fold was barely mentioned. Samsung was in the midst of a foldable disaster at its last Unpacked event, preparing to relaunch the Galaxy Fold after review units fell apart. It was a disaster that's generated a lot of doubt over folding phones, so this second folding phone from Samsung has a lot to prove.
