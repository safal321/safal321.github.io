Auto Mode is a new feature coming to Amazon's Alexa app that turns your phone into a “driver-friendly display” when used with Alexa auto accessories like the Echo Auto, the company says. As well as offering access to Alexa's typical voice commands, it includes large touchscreen icons that provide access to features like directions, music playback, and making calls. Amazon says the mode will be available in the Alexa app on iOS and Android in the coming weeks “when paired to an Echo Auto or other supported Alexa Auto accessories.”
