I've spent the past week with an Xbox Series X in my living room. I've played a variety of games on this preview unit, testing load times, performance, and some of the new Series X features. I switched back to an older Xbox One X briefly during testing, and it was like going from cable internet back to the days of a 56k modem. That's how much the Xbox Series X improves the games you already play every day. Everything just feels better.
