Fortnite's next big in-game event is happening soon (though it's already reached capacity, so you'll need to watch it online if you aren't in a game). An ominous countdown in the Fortnite lobby, in Midas' room in the battle pass menu, and above the central Agency building on the map is marking the time until 2:05PM ET. Hopefully, when the countdown reaches zero, Epic Games will treat players to another in-game spectacle on par with the rocket launch, the destruction of beloved landmark Tilted Towers, or the black hole event.
