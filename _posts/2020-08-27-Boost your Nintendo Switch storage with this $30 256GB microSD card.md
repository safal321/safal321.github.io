If you own a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite console, or are planning to get one soon, buying a microSD card to expand its internal storage should be your next move. Today, that comes as an affordable move to make, as Amazon has discounted Samsung's 256GB microSD card by nearly half of its original price. It's $30 for the rest of the day. Given that most Nintendo Switch games rarely soar above 10 or 15GB each (with many well below that size), this small investment should go a long way.
