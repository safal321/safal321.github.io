Apple has lost an early challenge in its lawsuit against Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing. Ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the judge presiding over the case has dismissed Apple's copyright infringement claim over Corellium's software, finding that Corellium's use of Apple code constituted fair use. The judge deferred ruling on a separate Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) charge, but the result is still a significant setback for the iPhone manufacturer's legal case. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.
