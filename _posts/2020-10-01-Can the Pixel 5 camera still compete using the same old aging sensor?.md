Google's new Pixel phones are here, as is the annual round of speculation over how their cameras will perform. The Pixel cameras have been in a weird spot for a couple of years; the Pixel 2 in 2017 was an incredible leap forward for smartphone photography, but features like Night Sight aside, the 3 and 4 were mostly evolutions on the same hardware and software formula, making what sometimes felt like subjective tweaks more than clear improvements to image quality. It's to Google's credit that they've still remained among the very best phone cameras you can buy.
