Motorola has announced several low-cost devices with big batteries and fast-refreshing displays this year, and now it's offering its least expensive model yet: the Moto G20. Launching in Europe this week for xe2x82xac149 (about $180), it includes a 6.5-inch 720p LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 5,000mAh battery. It's the latest in a series of budget devices from Motorola targeting slightly different price points in the budget range, and it would likely have a place in the US market if the company chose to offer it in the States.
