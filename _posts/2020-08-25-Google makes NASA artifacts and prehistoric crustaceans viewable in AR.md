Google has made a number of prehistoric creatures and historical artifacts available to view in augmented reality in its Arts and Culture app, the company announced today. If you want to take a closer look at the ancient crustacean Cambropachycope from your living room without having to visit Moscow's State Darwin Museum, for example, then now's your chance. Or how about the Command Module from Apollo 11 or Neil Armstrong's lunar spacesuit?
