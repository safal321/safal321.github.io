Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday during an all-hands meeting that they will not be required to get vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine to return to the office once the social media giant begins reopening its facilities, Facebook tells The Verge. Facebook employs more than 50,000 corporate employees, a vast majority of which have been working from home since the beginning of the year. The news of Zuckerberg's internal comments was first reported by The Daily Beast.
