Amazon unveiled a radically redesigned $49.99 fourth-generation Echo Dot smart speaker today that doesn't look like a dot at all â€” instead, the new Dot is shaped like a ball, or maybe an orb. The new design is a notable departure from the look of previous Echo Dots, which were short, puck-like cylinders that could be said to resemble, well, dots.
