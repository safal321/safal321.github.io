Let's face it, it's been a long and hard year for the denizens of our planet since Earth Day's 50th anniversary in 2020. However, it's possible that things are looking up somewhat. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging in many parts of the world, we do have vaccines that may eventually get us past this. And in the meantime, the Biden administration in DC is putting environmental programs in place that may get the US back on track. So perhaps it's worth doing a little partying (and educating) on behalf of this year's annual celebration of the environmental movement, which is set for April 22nd.
