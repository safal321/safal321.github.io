Twitter will add pinned tweets and short descriptions to some of the trending topics on its service to help people understand why they've become popular. In a blog post announcing the news, the company said it would immediately start adding representative pinned tweets to some topics in the iOS and Android apps, and that these would be coming to Twitter on the web soon.
