LG's Velvet will be available in the US starting tomorrow, July 22nd, following its launch in South Korea and several European countries. The midrange phone will debut online at AT&T with support for its 5G network, costing $20 per month for 30 months (totaling $600). For a limited time, the carrier is offering the phone for half that monthly cost if you buy one on an installment plan with a new line of service. AT&T will carry the Velvet in stores starting on August 7th.
