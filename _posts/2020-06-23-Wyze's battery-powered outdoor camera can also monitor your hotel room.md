Wyze's first outdoor camera — the appropriately titled Wyze Cam Outdoor — is a battery-powered, water-resistant, Wi-Fi security camera designed to be used outside. It costs $49.99 for a starter bundle, including the camera and a base station, or $39.99 for each additional camera. There's also an offline travel mode that allows the Cam Outdoor to monitor your hotel room, for example. The camera is available in what Wyze is calling “early access” starting today with deliveries expected in mid-July. Widespread availability is expected to follow in early August.
