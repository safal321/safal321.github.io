Verizon has been told to stop making misleading claims about the speed and coverage of its 5G network in its ads, the National Advertising Division (NAD) has announced. The organization, which runs the ad industry's self-regulatory system and is part of BBB National Programs, took issue with two TV ads, in particular, which it said suggest that Verizon's 5G service is widely available across the country and that customers can get expect speeds as fast as “2 gigs.” Verizon said it will comply with the NAD's recommendations, which are to stop making these claims.
