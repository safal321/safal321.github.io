Disney is moving two of its biggest 2021 releases to steaming, with both Black Widow and Cruella now set to debut on Disney Plus as $30 Premiere Access titles alongside their theatrical releases. Additionally, Black Widow has been delayed an additional two months: it'll now debut in both theaters and on Disney Plus on July 9th, instead of the previous May 7th release date. (Cruella, meanwhile, is still set to release on May 28th.)
