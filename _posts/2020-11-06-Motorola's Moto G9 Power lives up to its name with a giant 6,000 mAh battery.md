Motorola has announced the Moto G9 Power, a budget handset with one standout feature: a huge 6,000 mAh battery that Motorola claims will deliver up to 60 hours of battery life. It's not the biggest battery we've seen in a device of this caliber (Samsung's  Galaxy M51 has a 7,000 mAh battery, for example) but it's still certifiably chunky.
