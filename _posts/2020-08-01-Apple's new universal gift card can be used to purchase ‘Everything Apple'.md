If you wanted to buy yourself or someone you love an Apple gift card, it used to be a bit complicated. Apple offered two separate gift cards: an iTunes card, which you could use for purchases on the App Store, iTunes Store, and / or to increase your iCloud storage, and an Apple Store card, which was used on purchases made at the company's retail or online stores.
