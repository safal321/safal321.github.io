Airbnb is extending its extenuating circumstances policy to the US due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The policy ensures guests can cancel an eligible reservation without being charged, and it is currently in effect for bookings in mainland China, Italy, and South Korea. Airbnb says for US customers this applies to rentals booked before March 13th and with a check-in date of April 1st, 2020 or before.
