In case you were worried we might go a month without Lenovo announcing some new ThinkPad laptops, the company's come through with updates to several of its models. There are new P Series models, as well as a new third-generation X1 Extreme, all running Intel's 10th Gen processors. The big news here, is that as well as the spec bump these laptops will all support Lenovo's new Ultra Performance Mode, which it says gives you more control over performance settings.
