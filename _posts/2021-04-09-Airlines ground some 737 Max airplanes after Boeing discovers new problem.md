Boeing has recommended that airlines temporarily take the 737 Max out of service because of an issue with the plane's electrical systems. It's the latest in a now very long line of problems that have cropped up with this particular plane since two of them crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. But it's the first to ground the plane since the Federal Aviation Administration approved its return and it went back into service late last year.
