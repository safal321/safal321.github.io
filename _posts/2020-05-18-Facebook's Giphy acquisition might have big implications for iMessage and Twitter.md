Facebook is buying Giphy, and that means how you send and receive GIFs on the internet could change forever. The service claims that more than 700 million people see Giphy content every day, and many of those views come from some of the internet's most popular apps— from Apple's iMessage to TikTok and Twitter — most of which rely on Giphy's API and archives to let users share and post GIFs.
