Samsung has temporarily halted chip production at its facilities in Austin, TX in response to the region's power outages brought on by Winter Storm Uri, the Austin American-Statesman reports. “With prior notice, appropriate measures have safely been taken for the facilities and wafers in production,” Samsung said in a statement, “We will resume production as soon as power is restored.” On Tuesday, Austin Energy confirmed it had ordered its biggest customers to shut down, although it's unknown how long they were without power.
