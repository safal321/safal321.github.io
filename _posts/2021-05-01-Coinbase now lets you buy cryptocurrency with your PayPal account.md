Coinbase has added the option for users to buy cryptocurrency using their PayPal accounts in the US, the company has announced. It says the feature offers a “familiar and trusted” experience for users buying any of the numerous cryptocurrencies that the exchange currently supports, and using PayPal as an intermediary means you don't have to give your bank account or debit card information directly to the cryptocurrency exchange. The feature will expand to other countries in the coming months.
