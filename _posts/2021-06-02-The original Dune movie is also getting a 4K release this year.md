Dennis Villeneuve's Dune isn't the only film adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel getting a 4K release this year. That's because the original adaptation, made in 1984 by a young David Lynch, is getting a limited edition 4K Blu-ray release on August 30th. The film was both a critical and box office bomb that Lynch later disowned, but it's also a fascinating historical artifact and sci-fi cult-classic.
