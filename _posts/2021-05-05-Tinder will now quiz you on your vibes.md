Tinder wants to give you more info on what you and a match have in common, so it's launching a new quiz feature to help out. The quizzes, called Vibes, will pop up once a week and ask an assortment of goofy questions, from “_____ is not picnic food” to “Are you always 20 minutes early or 10 minutes late?” Users' answers will be visible on their profile to other people who have taken the quiz; if two users match, their answers will appear in their chat together.
