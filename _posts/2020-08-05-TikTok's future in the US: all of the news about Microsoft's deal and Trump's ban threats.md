TikTok's future in the US is up in the air, and there's a lot of news about what may happen next with the massively popular Chinese-owned video-sharing service. It all started with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioning the possibility of a ban on July 6th, which escalated to President Trump saying he would ban the app from operating in the US the weekend of July 31st.
