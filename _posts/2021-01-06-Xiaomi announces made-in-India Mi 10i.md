Xiaomi has announced the Mi 10i, a new phone in its 10 series intended for the Indian market and manufactured in the country — that's what the “i” stands for, apparently. That said, it's essentially a rebranded, region-specific version of the Mi 10T Lite 5G, which is itself basically the same thing as the Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G.
