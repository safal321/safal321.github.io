Myanmar's government has blocked access to Facebook in the country, after users turned to the company's services to protest this week's military coup. In a statement given to The Wall Street Journal, Facebook confirmed that the country's telecoms providers had been ordered to block its services, adding, “We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information.” Myanmar's government has ordered the services to be blocked until Sunday.
