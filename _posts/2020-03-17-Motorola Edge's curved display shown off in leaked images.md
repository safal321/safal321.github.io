Photographs of Motorola's unannounced Edge smartphone have leaked online, giving us a glimpse at the device's curved 90Hz display and 3.5mm headphone jack. The images, which were published by XDA-Developers, appeared alongside details about the phone's specs. These include a Snapdragon 765 processor and 4,500mAh battery.
