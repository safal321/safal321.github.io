You can now trade-in your old Mac at Apple Stores in the US and Canada. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman notes that Apple's site has been edited to remove a disclaimer that says Mac trade-ins are online-only, and a representative from the company confirmed the policy change to Gizmodo. The change means the computers are accepted in-store along with other Apple devices like iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. This follows a Bloomberg report which said the new policy was coming this week.
