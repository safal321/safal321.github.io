Apple's new iPhone 12 lineup will ship without wall chargers or Lightning EarPods in the box to reduce the phone's environmental impact, the company announced today. Instead, they'll come with just a USB-C to Lightning cable. As well as the new phones, Apple is also removing the accessories from its existing iPhone models going forward.
