Even though Pokxc3xa9mon Go is turning five years old this week, it's still going strong with upcoming events, some notable fans, and what appears to be a whole lot of profit. It looks like Niantic's Pokxc3xa9mon Go brought in over $5 billion since its launch in July of 2016, averaging around a billion dollars per year, according to Sensor Tower analytics. The game started out as a viral sensation but has obviously had staying power over the five years that it's been around. Sensor Tower claims that Pokxc3xa9mon Go players spent $1.3 billion in 2020, besting its record-setting 2019 revenue by around $400 million.
