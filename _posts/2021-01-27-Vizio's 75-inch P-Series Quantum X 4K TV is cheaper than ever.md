Vizio's P-Series Quantum X remains the company's flagship line of QLED televisions. If you are in the market for a new TV and have room to fit a 75-inch device on your entertainment station, Vizio's P75Qx-H1 model is $1,600 at Best Buy, B&H Photo, and Vizio. This is $400 off its usual price and the lowest we have seen this TV go for yet.
