Fortnite's annual holiday event is back, and this time, it brings a surprise: the return of airplanes. “Operation Snowdown,” as it's called, lasts from December 18th to January 5th, and it adds the expected to the game, including a snowy map and free unlockables like a soldier snowman called Snowmando. Everyone who logs in before January 5th will also get a free caroling emote.
