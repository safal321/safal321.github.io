Amazon is developing a thin Echo device for users to mount on their walls and use as a “smart home command center,” according to a report in Bloomberg. The device could come with a 10- or 13-inch touchscreen display and be capable of controlling smart home devices, playing music and videos, and video chatting thanks to a built-in camera. Naturally, it's also said to include Amazon's Alexa voice assistant.
