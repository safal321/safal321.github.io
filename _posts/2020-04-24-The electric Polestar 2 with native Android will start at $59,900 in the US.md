The Polestar 2, the first all-electric car from the Volvo Car Group, will start at $59,900 when it comes to the United States later this year. Equipped with native Android Automotive, the five-door fastback-style electric car boasts about 408 horsepower and is supposed to get about 275 miles of range per charge. It will be sold in all 50 states, and Polestar says it will announce leasing and financing details “in the near future.”
