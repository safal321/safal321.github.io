Best Buy and Amazon are is offering the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 (GPS) for $249, smashing yesterday's discounted price of $299. This model normally sold for $399, and today's price drop makes it more affordable than — and superior to — the Apple Watch SE that costs $279. The one downside to this promo is that it only loops in the Product Red model that's all red, which might not go with your look.
