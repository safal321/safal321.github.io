Facebook will begin showing a prompt on its mobile app for the iPhone and iPad that's designed to convince users to allow ad tracking, in preparation for an upcoming privacy change in which Apple will force developers to obtain permission to track users across apps and websites in the future. The new screen, first reported on Monday by CNBC, will be shown to users globally starting today and will provide Facebook with early data on how Apple's privacy change might affect the social network's business, ahead of Apple's planned update in early spring that will make the opt-in request mandatory.
