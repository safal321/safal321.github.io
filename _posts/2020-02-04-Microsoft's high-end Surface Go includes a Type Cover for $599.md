Microsoft's Surface Go tablet comes bundled with a Type Cover at the Microsoft Store and Best Buy for $599.99, which is around $80 off the price you'd normally pay for both items: $549 for the tablet component alone, then another $100 or so for the Type Cover. This deal is for the fastest configuration of the Surface Go, which features 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. (Note: it's not fast compared to a standard Surface Pro 7, though it performed better than Dieter Bohn expected in his review.) One thing to note about storage: this model comes with an SSD, not the far slower eMMC storage that comes standard in the baseline model.
