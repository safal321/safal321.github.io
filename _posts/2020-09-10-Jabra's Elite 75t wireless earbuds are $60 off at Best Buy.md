At Best Buy, you can save $60 off the usual cost of Jabra's Elite 75t truly wireless earbuds, which are one of the best options around if you like a lot of bass in your sound. This price cut brings the black version down to a far more reasonable $120, though you have to be signed in with your Best Buy account to see the deal. Once you're logged in, a box should appear under the price, allowing you to check a box to knock the price down from the sale price of $150 to $120. This deal lasts until September 12th.
