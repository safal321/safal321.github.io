One of the most famous short films in cinema is an 1896 silent film about a train pulling into a station. An intrepid Reddit user has upscaled that film to 4K, brought its frame rate up to 60fps, and even added sound. The effect is impressive, turning a movie that's over 120 years old into something that seems like it could have been filmed today (via Digg).
