Google's midrange Pixel 3A and Pixel 3A XL are more affordable than ever today. Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo have discounted the 3A with 64GB of storage to $279 ($120 off). The larger Pixel 3A XL is seeing an even bigger $160 price cut at those stores, which brings the cost of the 64GB model down to $319. We've seen a lower price on the Pixel 3A around the holidays, though if you like big screens, there's never been a better deal for the Pixel 3A XL.
