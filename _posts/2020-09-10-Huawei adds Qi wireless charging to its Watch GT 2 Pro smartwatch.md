Huawei announced a new smartwatch and a pair of wireless earbuds during its annual developer conference today. The Watch GT 2 Pro is an updated version of last year's Watch GT 2, which can be recharged wirelessly using any Qi-compatible charger â€” a helpful inclusion that means you can recharge it using almost any mainstream wireless charger or even the back of certain smartphones like Samsung's recent flagships.
