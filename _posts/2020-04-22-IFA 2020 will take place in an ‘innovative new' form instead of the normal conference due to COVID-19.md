IFA announced on Twitter that its upcoming 2020 conference will be affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but it's not canceling the show. The Berlin government has banned events with more than 5,000 participants from taking place until October 24th, 2020 — well past the conference's usual timing in September.
