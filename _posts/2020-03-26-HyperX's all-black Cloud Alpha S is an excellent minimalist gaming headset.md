HyperX has added a new color variant to its lineup of Cloud Alpha S gaming headsets. It's called “blackout” and, as you'd probably expect, every single detail around the headset is pure black. A new color option usually isn't too big of a deal, but the result here is a headset ideally suited for a minimalist, of which there aren't many on the market. It doesn't really stand out at all, and that's what makes it look so good.
