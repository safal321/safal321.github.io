Top tennis players including Serena and Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, and (known Overwatch fan) Naomi Osaka will compete in a live-streamed Mario Tennis Aces doubles tournament this weekend. The players will be paired with other celebrities and athletes, including Karlie Kloss, Steve Aoki, and Gigi Hadid, in a tournament that's meant to offer a fun alternative to the pro sports that have gone missing due to the pandemic. The tournament is being called the “Stay at Home Slam,” and it'll stream on Facebook Gaming.
