Android 11 is on the way, bringing a bunch of new changes and features for phones and tablets. Google originally planned to release the beta during a reveal event on June 3rd, but the company delayed and ultimately canceled the event in favor of a quieter announcement. The public beta was released a week later, following a developer preview that was launched in February.
