Spotify launched a beta program today for clickable songwriter credits called “songwriter pages.” If a songwriter is included in the beta, listeners can click on their name in a track's credits to view a page with all of the songs they've written. Spotify added song credits back in 2018, but this is the first time any of them have been clickable.
