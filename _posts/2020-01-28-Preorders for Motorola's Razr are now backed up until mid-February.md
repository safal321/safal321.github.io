If you place a preorder for Motorola's Razr right now, you won't receive the phone until February 18th â€” more than 10 days after its launch date. The resurrected Razr, now with a folding screen, will exclusively hit Verizon on February 6th. Preorders opened up yesterday, and delivery dates for the $1,500 device were quickly pushed out by several days.
