It's easy to be underwhelmed by the new Apple TV 4K. It looks identical to Apple's first 4K streaming box introduced back in 2017, and the day-to-day experience of using it doesn't feel dramatically better when compared to that device. The biggest improvement is undoubtedly the redesigned second-generation Siri Remote that comes bundled with the new Apple TV 4K â€” but you can buy that separately for $59.
