Whether you're a new or not-so-new Switch owner, everyone needs some good games to play. If you want some of the best titles released for Nintendo's console, you can get them for $20 off their full $60 price. This isn't the first time we've seen these discounts, but it's rare that these price cuts extend to both physical and digital versions of the games. So if you'd prefer to purchase a game code so you can instantly download it to your microSD card, that's an option.
