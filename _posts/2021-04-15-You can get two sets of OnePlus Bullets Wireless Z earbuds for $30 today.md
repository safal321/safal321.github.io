OnePlus is celebrating the anniversary of its launch of some products, including the Bullets Wireless Z and Warp Charge accessories, by offering discounts on them. Today's best deal is on the Bullets Wireless Z, which are almost half-off at $30. Better yet, you can get two of them for the price of one, so your checkout price before tax will be just $30. This deal expires later today or once they sell out. I'd place your order sooner than later if you're looking for some wireless neckbud-style earbuds for you and a pal or family member.
