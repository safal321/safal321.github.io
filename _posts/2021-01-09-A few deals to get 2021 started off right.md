After a brief hiatus over the holiday, we're back with another Verge Deals dispatch. Since we last sent one of these out, many of the deals that filled our daily coverage around the holidays have come to an end, and recently, whenever a good sale comes around, it usually doesn't last too long. Simply put, the dealscape is a little barren right now. Nevertheless, I've put in some of the week's best offers for your perusal.
