If you purchased a Peloton bike or treadmill to exercise with during the pandemic, you'll soon have a new collection of classes to take from a familiar artist. This week, Peloton announced a multi-year partnership with cultural phenomenon Beyoncxc3xa9 â€” the artist will help curate classes for the fitness company's subscription service, starting with a series of Homecoming-themed classes in honor of historically Black colleges and universities. Peloton says that Beyoncxc3xa9 is one of the most requested artists for its playlists.
