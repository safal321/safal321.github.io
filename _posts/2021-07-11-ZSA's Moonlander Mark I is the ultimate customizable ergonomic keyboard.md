I've spent a lot of time with many ergonomic keyboards, but ZSA's Moonlander Mark I may be my favorite one I've ever used. It's a customizable mechanical keyboard that's split into two halves for better shoulder ergonomics. You can adjust its tilt to make it most comfortable to your hands. You can swap out the switches for any key without much effort. You can program multiple functions for every single key.
