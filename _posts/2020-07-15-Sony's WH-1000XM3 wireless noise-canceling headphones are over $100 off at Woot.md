Sony's WH-1000XM3 are a great investment if you're looking for a comfortable set of wireless, over-ear headphones that feature noise cancellation. The thing is, they're usually $350. Well, today Woot is offering a new set for $220, which is a 37 percent discount on that original price. This deal will last through today, though it will end earlier if it sells out of stock.
