Bungie has confirmed Destiny 2 will be getting crossplay support at some point next year. While Bungie didn't specify which platforms will support the feature, hopefully you'll be able to dive into Destiny 2 with players across every platform on which the game is available. That includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, PC, and Stadia. Earlier this year, it seemed as though a 2021 launch date for crossplay was the goal, but Bungie was more definite about a launch next year in a blog post published on Tuesday.
