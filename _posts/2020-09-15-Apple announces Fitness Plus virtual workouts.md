Apple is launching a new subscription service for virtual fitness classes called Fitness Plus, the company announced during its presentation today. The service integrates with iPhones, iPads, and the Apple TV, but Apple says it's built for the Apple Watch. Access to the service will cost $9.99 a month or $79.99 a year, and you'll get three months free with the purchase of a new Apple Watch. It also comes bundled as part of Apple's new Apple One subscription. Apple says Fitness Plus will be available before the end of the year.
