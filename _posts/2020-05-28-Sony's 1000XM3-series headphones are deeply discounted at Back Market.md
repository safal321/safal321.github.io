Sony's WH-1000XM3 over-ear headphones and the truly wireless WF-1000XM3 are both solid choices if you want great sound quality and noise cancellation, though they're definitely not the most affordable at the store. If you're willing to forgo buying them new, Back Market is offering them refurbished for up to 42 percent off their regular prices. The WH-1000XM3 are $200, which is a whole $150 off the price you'd pay for a new set. The truly wireless option are just $110, which is $80 off. What's important to note is that both include a one-year warranty.
