Madden now has a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed field so you can live out your dreams of playing football in a virtual Bikini Bottom. The SpongeBob Reef-Top, which will only be available in Madden's arcade-style The Yard mode, will offer challenges that you can complete to unlock Nickelodeon-themed content as well as gear inspired by the famous yellow sponge himself.
