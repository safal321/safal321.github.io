Aurora, the self-driving car company founded by former Waymo engineer Chris Urmson, doesn't do dog and pony shows. It doesn't trot out its vehicles just to prove they exist or take journalists for test drives to demonstrate that the technology actually works. In fact, in the three years since Aurora launched, the public has heard very little about how Aurora plans to compete against Waymo, Ford, and General Motors.
