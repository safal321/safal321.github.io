Elon Musk is getting in on the NFT gold rush by selling a new electronic music track he's apparently produced as an NFT. Yes, you've heard that right â€” it's a song about non-fungible tokens, which Musk appears to have minted (or plans to mint) on the blockchain. Musk did not include a link to the NFT, so it's not clear if it's already live or if Musk plans to initiate the sale at a later date. It's also not clear on which platform Musk intends to sell the NFT.
