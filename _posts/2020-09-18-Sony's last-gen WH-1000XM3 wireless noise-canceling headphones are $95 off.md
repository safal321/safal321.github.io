If you're in the market for a great set of wireless, over-ear headphones that have sublime noise cancellation and sound quality, Sony's WH-1000XM3 are $95 off at Woot, down to $255. Woot is selling the black model, which has bronze detailing in a few spots. It's brand-new and has a one-year warranty. This isn't the lowest price we've seen for this model; they dropped to $200 after its successor, the WH-1000X4, released earlier this year. And with Prime Day 2020 and Black Friday inching closer, it's likely that we'll see them go for even less. Still, this model is so good that we'll tell you whenever it's cheaper than usual.
