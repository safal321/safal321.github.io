Peloton this week announced that it will temporarily suspend the sale and delivery of its Tread, a treadmill with a touchscreen to stream live and on-demand classes, that the company released in 2018. In a blog post, Peloton says it has decided to put a hold on Tread deliveries because the size of the machine is too big to deliver to customers while attempting to maintain physical distance during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
