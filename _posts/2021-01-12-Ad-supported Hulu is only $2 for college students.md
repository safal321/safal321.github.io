Keeping up with every single streaming service is an expensive affair, but Hulu is offering US college students a special discounted plan at $2 a month. Typically, Hulu's ad-supported plan costs $5.99 a month. The new student plan, which is an evergreen offer and will run for the same price as long as students can verify their continued enrollment, offers more than a 65 percent discount. Students can sign up for the offer now.
