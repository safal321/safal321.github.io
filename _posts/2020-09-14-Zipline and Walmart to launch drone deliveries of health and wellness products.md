Zipline is partnering with Walmart for a new drone delivery operation in the US, the companies announced. The program is for on-demand deliveries of health and wellness products and will begin in a trial early next year near Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. Zipline's launch and release system allows for on-demand delivery in less than an hour, and operating from a Walmart store, can service a 50-mile radius.
