It's been nearly a year since many of us started working from home due to the pandemic, and if you haven't yet adjusted your workspace to accommodate your needs, then it's probably time to get to it. Whether you've set yourself up in the guest bedroom, on your living room couch, or in a walk-in closet, you may need a little extra to make it possible to type comfortably, meet online, or just concentrate. Sometimes it means buying a new desk, lamp, or monitor; sometimes it just means finding a household item that will make life a little easier.
