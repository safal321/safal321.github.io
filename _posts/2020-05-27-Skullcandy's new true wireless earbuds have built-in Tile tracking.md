Many true wireless earbuds now let you “find” them by either playing a sound (if they're powered on, out of their case, and nearby) or pulling up the location where they were last paired to your phone. But what if you could track your earbuds even when they're powered down? That's the appeal that has led an increasing number of brands to build Tile's tracking technology into their devices — including laptops, suitcases, and headphones from Bose and Sennheiser — and now Skullycandy is joining in.
