Panasonic has announced not one but two follow-up cameras to the Lumix GH5, a camera that's been popular with videographers since it launched in 2017. There's the GH6, which Panasonic says features a brand-new sensor and will launch by the end of the year for $2,500, and the GH5 Mark II, which is going up for preorder today, with a body-only package coming in at $1,700.
