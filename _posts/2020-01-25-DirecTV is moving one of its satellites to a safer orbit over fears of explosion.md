DirecTV fears that one of its satellites in orbit might blow up soon, and it's gearing up to move it to safety. Due to a problem with the satellite's batteries, the satellite might burst apart at the end of February. If it did explode while in its current orbit, there's a chance it could damage active satellites nearby, which is why the company would like to get it out of the way.
