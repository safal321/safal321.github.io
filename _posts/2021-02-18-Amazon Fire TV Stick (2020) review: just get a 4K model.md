Amazon's new Fire TV Stick is a $39.99 streaming dongle that's aimed at people who haven't yet made the upgrade to a 4K TV â€” and don't intend to anytime soon. It maxes out at 1080p video resolution, but offers support for modern tricks like HDR and Dolby Atmos surround sound. That's a weird zone to be in when rival products like the Chromecast with Google TV go all-in on 4K for not much more money.
