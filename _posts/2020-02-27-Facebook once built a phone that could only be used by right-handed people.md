Yesterday I chatted here with author Steven Levy about his new book, Facebook: The Inside Story. Today I wanted to share some of my favorite parts of the story, focusing on Levy's considerable original reporting. While I'm sharing my favorite parts here, I'm still leaving a ton out. This book is 527 pages, and a memorable event takes place on more pages than not. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a comprehensive, reality-based account of the company's first 16 years.
