Alongside the Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition, Dell is also launching a more affordable 15-inch Dell G15 Ryzen Edition gaming laptop. It's for people who still want to experience AMD's fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors, along with an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip, but for less. If the M15 R5's $1,793.98 starting price is too high, the G15's $899.99 entry-level configuration might be a more reasonable price point for you to jump in.
