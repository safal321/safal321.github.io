Microsoft's first-gen Surface Headphones might not be the latest set of noise-canceling headphones, but they're still a stellar value â€” especially today. They have good sound quality, USB-C charging, a comfy fit, and they can block out a considerable amount of noise. Today at Woot, you can get them new for just over $80. To get this price, you'll need to download the Woot app (iOS, Android), then find the deal there. Doing that alone will save 15 percent on the price it'll cost everyone else, which is $96. These headphones used to cost $250 (and most competitors cost more than that), so you're getting a good deal either way. If you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping on this order.
