Google is making good on its promise from August to bring Google Maps back to the Apple Watch after yanking it back in 2017. It's available now, and as we wrote last month, its noteworthy features include providing route estimates and step-by-step directions to and from pre-saved locations on your wrist. Google Maps first became available for the Apple Watch in 2015, but it hasn't been available to download since 2017 when Google removed the app without explaining why.
