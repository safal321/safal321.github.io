Amazon's Fire HD 8 tablet is a tough value to beat at its usual $80 price, but today, that deal gets even better with a $30 price drop. You can snag a Fire HD 8 for $50. It has 16GB of internal storage, and you can insert up to a 400GB microSD card to expand the storage that's available. This model has a rear-facing camera and a selfie camera, so you can keep in touch with friends and relatives with it out of the box. For this price, you'll be getting the tablet with “special offers” included, which are just Amazon's own ads set to your tablet lock screen.
