If you're planning to take some time away from work, it might be a good idea to set up a vacation responder: an automatic reply that goes out to anyone who emails you, letting them know you're out of the office and therefore not checking email regularly. (It's also a good idea to let them know in that email when you'll be back.) On Gmail, it's an easy thing to set up, and you can choose start and end dates for the automatic reply.
