Huawei's new MatePad Pro 5G is a 5G version of the 10.8-inch tablet it announced last year for the Chinese market. When combined with its keyboard case and M-Pencil, the tablet invites some obvious comparisons to Apple's iPad Pro, but Huawei's tablet has a couple of unique features up its sleeve. These include two-way wireless changing, the ability to mirror the screen of a paired smartphone, and the aforementioned 5G connectivity. The tablet will ship with open-source Android, without Google's apps or services.
