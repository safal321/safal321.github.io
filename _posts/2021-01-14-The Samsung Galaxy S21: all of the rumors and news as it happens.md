Samsung will be holding its Unpacked event on January 14th at 10AM ET, and we've already got a pretty clear picture of what it'll be releasing. Obviously, the Galaxy S21 will be shown off in its regular, Plus, and Ultra varieties, and it seems like we'll be seeing a new pair of wireless earbuds and tracking tags alongside the phones. This post has all of the rumors we've gathered up until now, and we'll be adding all of the news from the event as it happens.
