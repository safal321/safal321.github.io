Razer's Hammerhead True Wireless Pro earbuds are a major improvement over the company's first pair of true wireless earbuds. They've switched from an open-air design to a sealed fit; have better sound, thanks to that decision (and a partnership with THX); and they offer adequate active noise cancellation. Razer has thrown in a generous heap of ear tips (including Comply foam), and there's also a low-latency gaming mode to keep the earbuds in sync with your mobile gaming.
