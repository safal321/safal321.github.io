Amazon shared with us that more Prime Day 2020 deals would start on October 6th, and that's today. Starting now, you can save on more TVs and other smart home products, if you're in the market for those. Keep in mind, though, that you'll need to be signed in with a Prime account to be able to see some of the price drops take place. One of the newly discounted devices is the Amazon Echo Show 5 smart display, which is $45 instead of $90 â€” a full 50 percent price drop.
