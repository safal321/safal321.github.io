The JBL Quantum One wired PC gaming headset has one really interesting trick that unfortunately isn't worth the hype â€” or the $300 price. It uses a gyroscope to track your head movements while you play games in order to enhance the surround-sound effect. Compared to most headsets that use only software-based surround sound, JBL's hardware can make you feel like you're in the game itself.
