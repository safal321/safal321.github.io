Apple made a quiet and significant change to iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 this week, allowing users to set default email and browser apps. It's a move that means iPhone and iPad owners will be able to click on web links or email addresses in any app and have them open in their favorite browser or email client. But that's as far as Apple's default apps choices go. Apple will still force everyone to use its own apps for photos, maps, music, messaging, calendars, and more.
