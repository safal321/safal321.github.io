Twitter is officially rolling out its new quote tweets counter, which lets you easily see every time a given tweet has been retweeted alongside a comment. “Tweets about a Tweet add more to the conversation, so we've made them even easier to find,” the company said, also noting that the new counter will be shown between the existing “Retweets” and “Likes” labels.
