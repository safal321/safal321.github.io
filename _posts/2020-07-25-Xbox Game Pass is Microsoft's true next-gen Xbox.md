If you were heading into Microsoft's Xbox game showcase yesterday to witness a demonstration of why next-gen gaming and the “world's most powerful console” matter, you were probably left a little disappointed. Microsoft's event featured a solid showcase for the future of Xbox and Xbox Game Studios content, but it did little to convince me why I should buy an Xbox Series X. Instead, it made it clear that the Xbox Series X is just one of many ways you can play Xbox games, and that Microsoft's true next-gen focus is Xbox Game Pass.
