TikTok creators can now add Donation Stickers to their videos and live streams to encourage followers to donate to charitable causes during the coronavirus pandemic, the company has announced. Once added, users can tap the stickers to instantly be taken to a donation page within the app where they can add credit card details and the donation amount. TikTok says it will match the first $10 million donated globally until May 27th.
