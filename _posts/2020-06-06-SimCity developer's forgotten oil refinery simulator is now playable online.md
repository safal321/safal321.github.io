SimRefinery, an all-but-forgotten oil refinery simulator from the studio behind SimCity, has been rediscovered and uploaded to the web as a playable game, ArsTechnica reports. The existence of the game came to light last month after it appeared in a wide-ranging report about Maxis' little-known business simulations division. Now, however, an anonymous user has uploaded the game to the Internet Archive, where it's actually playable in a browser thanks to a built-in DOSBox emulator.
