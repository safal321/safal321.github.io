9to5Mac has managed to obtain code for an early build of Apple's iOS 14 update, and it has revealed a preview (albeit a small one) of the company's rumored over-ear headphones. Two icons for unreleased headphones have been discovered in the code; they're the glyphs that Apple uses to indicate battery / volume levels for connected headphones in iOS and iPadOS. 9to5Mac found both light and dark icons, indicating that Apple will likely offer at least two color options for the headphones. AirPods and AirPods Pro continue to only be available in white.
