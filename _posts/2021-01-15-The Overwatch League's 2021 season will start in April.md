For its first three years of existence, the Overwatch League has kicked off early in the year. But that's going to change in 2021. Today, Blizzard announced that its ambitious esports league will begin play in April. It will also be the first season in which the league starts off with remote matches — and there will be some big changes to accommodate that. “To take full advantage of what was learned last season, we've made several changes that will improve the quality of competition and the fan experience for this coming season,” Blizzard says.
