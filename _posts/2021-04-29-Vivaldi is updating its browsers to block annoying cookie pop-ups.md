Vivaldi announced today that it's updating the desktop and Android versions of its Vivaldi browser with the ability to block annoying cookie preference pop-ups. Thanks to the passage of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you've probably had to click through at least one dialog box asking if you'd like to manage how a site tracks you. Vivaldi's new update lets you avoid those notifications — with some major caveats — while theoretically still keeping you safe from tracking.
