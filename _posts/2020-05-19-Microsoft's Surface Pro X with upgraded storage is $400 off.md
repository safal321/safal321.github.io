One of today's best deals is on Microsoft's Surface Pro X, a tech product that's only seen small price cuts. At Amazon and Best Buy, you can get a big discount on the upgraded model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It's down to $900 (usually $1,299). For context, the base model launched at $999, so getting the version with more storage for $100 less than that reads as a good deal to me.
