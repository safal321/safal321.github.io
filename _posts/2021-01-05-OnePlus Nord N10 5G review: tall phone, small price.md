The OnePlus Nord N10 5G does something unique: bring 5G to a $299.99 phone without cutting too many corners. That's a full $200 lower than other budget-oriented competitors like the Google Pixel 4A 5G and Samsung Galaxy A51 5G. Alongside its lower-tier N100 sibling, it's the first phone in OnePlus' midrange Nord series to arrive in the US, available from T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, and unlocked from OnePlus.com and other retailers.
