Netflix's newest original series Next In Fashion isn't taking chances when it comes to viewers skipping episodes or quitting the show entirely. Hosts Tan France and Alexa Chung directly command viewers to click through to the next episode at the end of the one preceding it, taking a cue from YouTubers who often push people to subscribe to their channels or click through to another video. The decision also highlights the new, cutthroat nature of Netflix Originals and the possibility of being canceled after only one season. Stakes are high for show creators.
