Taika Waititi will direct and co-write a new Star Wars movie for theatrical release, Disney announced today. It won't be Waititi's first brush with the Star Wars universe; he directed the season finale of The Mandalorian. He also earned an Academy Award for his screenplay for Jojo Rabbit and directed Thor: Ragnarok. Rumors of a Waititi-helmed Star Wars movie first surfaced in January, though it's unclear if this movie is the one that Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige is reportedly developing.
