Sam Sheffer, a tech YouTuber and former staffer at The Verge, posted a video on Friday revealing some unreleased products from the now-defunct electric skateboard startup Boosted, whose assets have been acquired by scooter company Lime and most of the company's remaining inventory was obtained by a retailer in San Francisco. Sheffer shows images and photos of two bikes, a super-powered electric skateboard, a board with Tony Hawk's Birdhouse brand, a board with an LED light ring around the edge, and more.
