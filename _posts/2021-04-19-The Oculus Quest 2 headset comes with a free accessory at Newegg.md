If you're hunting for an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, Newegg has an appealing sale happening on bundles that will net you a free accessory. For $350, you can get the 64GB headset (normally $300 by itself) with Logitech's G333 VR wired earbuds and the Oculus Elite strap. Both accessories would usually add $100 to the total, but with this bundle, you're saving $49, so it's like you're getting the ever-useful and comfortable Elite strap for free.
