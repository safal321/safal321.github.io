It may be difficult to celebrate the holidays in person with family and friends this year, but if you're planning to send some special gifts to your loved ones, there are two annual events that you can still look forward to: Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This year, of course, it will take place primarily online, but that doesn't mean you won't find a wide range of deals from big-box stores like Target, Best Buy, and Walmart and online retailers like Amazon, Newegg, and more.
