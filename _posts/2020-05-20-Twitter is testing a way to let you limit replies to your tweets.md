Twitter is testing a way to let you limit how many people can reply to your tweets. If you're part of the test, when you compose a tweet, you'll be able to select if you'll allow replies from everyone, people you follow, or only people you @ mention. Twitter said in January that this feature would be coming to the platform sometime this year.
