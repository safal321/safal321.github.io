General Motors has decided to make some 2021 full-size pickups without a certain fuel management module because of the ongoing microchip shortage. As a result, those trucks will get around one fewer mile per gallon of gas, meaning they'll burn more fuel to go the same distance, releasing more carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
