Twitter has shared three early design concepts for new features it's considering for its service. “Trusted Friends” would let users limit the audience for select tweets to a smaller circle of close friends, while “Facets” could let you categorize your tweets when you send them. Finally, the service is also considering letting users list certain phrases that they'd rather not see in their replies. These ideas are in their early stages, Twitter says, and none are currently in active development.
