A different kind of shared electric scooter has landed in a small suburb outside Atlanta, Georgia. These scooters look bulkier than your average shared two-wheelers, with extra components attached to the deck and handlebars. And they're also not technically two-wheelers, but rather four-wheelers with an added set of training wheels in the middle of the deck. That's because they're the first remote-controlled scooters to launch into commercial service in the US.
