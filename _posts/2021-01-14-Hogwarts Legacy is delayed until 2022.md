One of the year's biggest games has been delayed. Today, Warner Bros. announced that Hogwarts Legacy — an open-world, action roleplaying game set in the Harry Potter universe — will be launching next year instead of in 2021. “We are giving the game the time it needs,” the developer said in a tweet. No specific release date was announced.
