MSI has admitted that its subsidiary Starlit Partner got access to MSI's new GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards in “error,” after it was found selling them at huge markups on eBay. After links between the two companies emerged, users on Reddit accused MSI of taking advantage of stock shortages to “scalp” customers with inflated prices via a subsidiary. MSI says that anyone who bought graphics cards over their MSRP from Starlit will be offered the choice of a full or partial refund.
