One of the best deals of Prime Day has returned at Newegg. Sony's WH-1000XM4 wireless noise-canceling headphones in black are down to $284 instead of $350. This actually beats the $298 pricing at Amazon and Best Buy by $14, though, unlike those retailers' deal earlier this week, this one doesn't include a gift card. That's no matter if you're just looking for the lowest price â€” this is it.
