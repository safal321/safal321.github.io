Dreams, the latest game-meets-game-making toolkit from Media Molecule on PS4, is down to $25 at Amazon, GameStop, and Best Buy. It normally costs $40, and if you're spending a lot of time at home — like most of us are — now might be the perfect time to jump into a game like this. You can play other people's game creations, and create miniature games of your own with tools that offer surprising versatility, depending on your skill level. People have recreated P.T., the cult classic horror demo, but really, it's the original stuff that stands out the most.
