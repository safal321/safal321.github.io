This isn't new information but more of a PSA that you only have one more day to preorder the Galaxy S21, which will get you a few perks you wouldn't get otherwise. Every major US carrier and most retailers are accepting preorders for the S21, S21 Plus, and the high-end S21 Ultra through Thursday, January 28th. No matter where you buy it, you'll get up to $200 in Samsung credit to pick up a few accessories on its site, along with a complimentary Samsung SmartTag to help keep track of your stuff.
