Google's latest Pixel Buds wireless earbuds don't go on sale often, but Best Buy has knocked $80 off their normal $179 cost for today only. The catch is that these are refurbished and only available in the white color. Still, $100 is a good deal if you wanted to try these out without paying close to full price.
