The TCL 20 5G is one of many affordable 5G phones we'll see this year, and at xe2x82xac299, it will launch a full xe2x82xac100 cheaper than last year's TCL 10 5G. Using a less expensive 5G-equipped 600-series Qualcomm processor likely enabled the price drop. Otherwise, it looks to be a modest iteration of the previous model. TCL isn't providing information now about US availability or pricing, only that “some” of the five 20-series phones it will announce this year will come to the US.
