Intel has just announced its new 11th Gen processors, and alongside the launch, the company is also rolling out a new minimalist logo â€” the third logo that the company has ever used. The fresh design replaces the previous branding with the Intel wordmark enclosed in a circle that has been used by the company in various forms since 2006.
