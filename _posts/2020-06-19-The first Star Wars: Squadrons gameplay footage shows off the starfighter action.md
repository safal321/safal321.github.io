After a teaser trailer earlier this week, EA has finally shown off some actual gameplay footage for Star Wars: Squadrons, its new starfighter dogfighting game. As promised, the new title is a first-person space shooter focused around five-on-five team battles, as players group up into their own squadron (made up, of course, of classic Star Wars ships).
