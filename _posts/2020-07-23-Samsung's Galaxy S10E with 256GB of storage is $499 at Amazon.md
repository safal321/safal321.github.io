Amazon's deal of the day is on the 256GB version of the Samsung Galaxy S10E in black. It's currently down to $499 â€” its most affordable price yet. At this time last year, $750 was the typical price you'd pay to get one; more recently, it's sold for $699. What's great about this deal is that it's for the upgraded version of the phone, which not only has double the storage capacity of the base model but its RAM count is 8GB compared to 6GB, so it should remain a speedy companion for a few years.
