Amazon has named Salesforce executive Adam Selipsky as the replacement for Andy Jassy, the longtime chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the company's next CEO when founder Jeff Bezos steps down later this year. Selipsky worked at AWS for more than 10 years, raising to the rank of vice president of sales and marketing, before running the startup Tableau, which is now part of Salesforce. Selipsky's hiring was first reported by CNBC, which published a memo Jassy sent to Amazon employees on Wednesday announcing the news.
