If it's a thin gaming laptop you seek, Asus makes several, including last year's excellent ROG Zephyrus G14 and the intriguing ROG Flow x13 2-in-1 that we recently reviewed. The TUF Dash F15 is the latest option to join the pack, and it's the one that might catch your eye if you're looking for a laptop outfitted with an Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics chip and an 11th Gen Intel Core H-series processor, in addition to other perks like a Thunderbolt 4 port and a fast refresh rate display.
