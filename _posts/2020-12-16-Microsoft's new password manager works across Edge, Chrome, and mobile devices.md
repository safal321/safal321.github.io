Microsoft is building a new password manager that syncs credentials across its Edge browser, Google Chrome, and mobile iOS or Android devices. A preview version of the password manager is now built into Microsoft Authenticator, a free mobile app that's used for multi-factor authentication. Like many other password managers, it can autofill passwords in apps or websites on iOS or Android.
