Humble Bundle has launched its Fight for Racial Justice Bundle, which contains over $1,200 worth of PC games, comics, and books. Unlike many of its previous bundles that let you choose how your payment is divvied up, this bundle funnels 100 percent of what you pay directly to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Race Forward, and The Bail Project. And when you donate to these organizations, you're helping in the fight against racial injustices inflicted upon black people in the US.
