Spotify's product lead for cars and wearables teased an exciting new feature coming to Wear devices during Google's Developer Keynote on Tuesday: the ability for the streaming services' 356 million users to download music directly to their watch, and listen to it at times when they don't want to carry their phone (via XDA Developers).
