Last week, we saw Apple announce an addition to its smartphone lineup as well as a new keyboard case for the iPad Pro. This week on The Vergecast, co-hosts Nilay, Dieter, and Paul discuss The Verge's reviews of those products: the new iPhone SE and the Magic Keyboard.<br/><br/>Starting at $399, the iPhone SE joins a group of smartphones in a competitive price range far below flagship phones. Does spending less still get you a satisfactory iPhone experience?<br/><br/>In addition to the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro, Logitech released a keyboard case for the rest of the iPad lineup. How do the two cases compare in affordability, durability, and design?<br/><br/>There's a whole bunch of other news sprinkled throughout the show — like Paul's weekly segment “Tap me on the shoulder”, a bunch of spectrum opening up for Wi-Fi, and an update on the tech world's response to COVID-19. You can listen here or in your preferred podcast player to hear it all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Listen toxc2xa0Thexc2xa0Vergecast,xc2xa0the only podcast you need to make sense of this week's tech news, hosted by Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn.xc2xa0Subscribe here!<br/><br/>Stories discussed this week:<br/><br/>The Vergecast<br/><br/>
