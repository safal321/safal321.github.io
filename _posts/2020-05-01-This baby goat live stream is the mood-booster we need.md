Every once in a while, I hear a cascade of “bleeeeats” from my laptop speakers. For the past several weeks, I've been leaving a live stream of goats running while I work. It's not really something you tune into for 30 seconds and then peace out of: this is a stream you keep on in the background, do some work, and then revisit for a soothing break in your day. And don't worry, the goats will let you know when it's time to tune back in. Bleeeat!
