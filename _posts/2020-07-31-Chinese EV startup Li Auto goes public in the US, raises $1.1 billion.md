The latest electric vehicle startup to cash in on a new wave of hype and investment in the space is Li Auto, a five-year-old Chinese company that started trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday after raising $1.1 billion in an initial public offering. It's the second Chinese EV startup to become a publicly traded company in the United States, following Nio's 2018 IPO and subsequent listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Another, XPeng, will reportedly be next.
