Courtney Atencio rides low to the ground, swerving in and out of long, empty California streets. In one video, she grabs the back of a Toyota Camry and cruises along behind it. In another, she's with her pals, practicing tricks at a local skate park. Every time, Atencio's clips are undeniably cool, and they quickly become flooded with comments from fans asking for tips on how to start skating. Atencio didn't start skating or her TikTok account to achieve fame, but she quickly found communities in both that she never experienced when she was growing up.
