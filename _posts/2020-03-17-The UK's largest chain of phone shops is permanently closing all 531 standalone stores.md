UK phone retailer Carphone Warehouse is closing its 531 standalone stores, its parent company Dixons Carphone announced today. Although the company said 40 percent of the retailer's employees will be reassigned within the business, the move is expected to result in the loss of 2,900 jobs. The company's phone sales will move both online, and to Carphone-branded areas within the company's larger Currys PCWorld shops.
