Jake Paul finally commented on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's raid on his home last week, saying that the search was related to a “looting” incident at an Arizona mall in May. “There are rumors about it having to do with so many other things that have nothing to do with me or my character, and the shit that people are making up is absolutely absurd,” Paul said in a video that appears to have been deleted but was captured by TMZ.
