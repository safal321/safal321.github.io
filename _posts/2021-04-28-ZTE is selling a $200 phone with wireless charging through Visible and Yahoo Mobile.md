ZTE is offering a feature rarely seen in the budget class of phones: wireless charging. The Blade 11 Prime is on sale now in the US for $192 through Visible and Yahoo Mobile, two MVNOs that use Verizon's network. It's an otherwise fairly unremarkable budget device, with a 6.5-inch 720p display shipping with Android 11.
