T-Mobile said Thursday it is once again moving to tackle robocalls by scammers, repackaging several features it's had in place for a while as a program it's calling Scam Shield. It includes free caller ID and call blocking, free enhanced caller ID to let people know when a number calling is verified, and a free second “proxy” number to filter out scam calls from coming to personal phone lines.
