Bose's original true wireless earbuds, the SoundSport Free, sounded fantastic but were foiled by connectivity problems and audio / video sync issues that the company never fully resolved.

This allowed Apple, Sony, and others to seize the market with products like the AirPods Pro and WF-1000XM3 earbuds.
