Samsung's T7 portable SSD is now available following its introduction earlier this year at CES 2020. The T7 is the successor to the slim, wallet-sized T5 USB-C SSD that came out in 2017. If you're feeling some sort of dxc3xa9jxc3xa0 vu and are wondering if this product might have already been released â€” well, yes, sort of. Back in January, Samsung released the T7 Touch, a slightly more expensive variant that features a fingerprint sensor for authenticating your identity before the SSD mounts to your device.
