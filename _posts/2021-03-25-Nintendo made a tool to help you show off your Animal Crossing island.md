Nintendo has a new tool that lets show off your Animal Crossing: New Horizons island with a poster or even a trailer. While you've always been able to take screenshots and video clips from the game using the Switch's built-in tools and share those with your friends and on social media, the new Island Tour Creator lets you add some Animal Crossing-themed flair to what you've captured.
