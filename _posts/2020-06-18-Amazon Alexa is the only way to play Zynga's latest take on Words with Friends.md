Game developer Zynga is launching a revised version of its once-popular Scrabble-like web game Words with Friends exclusively for Amazon Alexa today. The new game, called Word Pop, is a voice-based version of the word game that asks players to spell as many unique words as they can from a given six-letter bank across one-minute sessions. Players are scored based on the length of words and the total number of words.
