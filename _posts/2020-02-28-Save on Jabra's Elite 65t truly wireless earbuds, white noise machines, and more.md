Jabra's Elite 65t truly wireless earphones aren't the newest to hit the market, but they're still easy to recommend if you're looking for a set that offer good sound quality, reliable wireless connectivity, and a comfortable fit. If you don't want to spend more than $100 on wireless earbuds, you should check out Best Buy's deal. They're $90, down from their usual price of around $130, and currently, all three colorways are available at this price (beige / gold, titanium / black, and copper / black).
