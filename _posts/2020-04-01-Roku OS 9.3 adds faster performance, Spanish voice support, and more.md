Roku is today announcing the latest software update that's coming soon to Roku streaming devices and Roku TVs. Roku OS 9.3 will expand the company's voice command system to include Spanish language support. Spanish-speaking users can now use their voice to launch streaming apps, search for something to watch, or control media playback. In Canada, the UK, and Ireland, Roku Voice is also being improved to understand more natural speech and “new ways to find entertainment such as searching by a selection of popular movie quotes.”
