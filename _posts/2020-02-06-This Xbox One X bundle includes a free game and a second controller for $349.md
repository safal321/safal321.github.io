It was a big deal when Microsoft slashed $150 off the price of the Xbox One X ahead of Black Friday 2019. You can still find those consoles for the same $349 price, which is a great value, but Dell's deal goes a little further. Right now, $349 can get you an Xbox One X console bundled with the excellent Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order as well as a second Xbox wireless controller.
