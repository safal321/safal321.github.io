Apple rumors have heated up in the past week, following the usual spring tradition. Apple doesn't always have a keynote in the first quarter of the year, but when it does it's a good time for it to update or announce products that aren't necessarily central to its business. But the leaks and innuendo so far don't have the air of inevitability that often accompanies Apple rumors yet, so I wouldn't block off your calendar just yet.
