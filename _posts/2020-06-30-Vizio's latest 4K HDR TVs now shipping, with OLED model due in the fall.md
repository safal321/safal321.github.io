First announced back at CES, Vizio's latest lineup of 4K TVs is starting to roll out to retailers. The company's first OLED model will take a little longer and isn't expected to ship until the fall, however. Still, the other sets in the 2020 family — Vizio is confusingly calling it the 2021 lineup for some reason — should offer excellent picture quality and be near the top of your list if you're planning to upgrade your TV for the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X this holiday.
