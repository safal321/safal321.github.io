The latest update to Overcast, a popular iOS podcast app, is bringing new transparency to podcast ads. Listeners who are in the beta can now view the services their favorite podcasts use to serve ads and track listeners. This means listeners will be able to tell when a podcast is using dynamic advertising, which allows networks to swap and target ads based on the specific person listening. For most people, this likely won't change the shows they enjoy, but for the audience that cares or wants more information about how a podcast serves them ads, it's a notable transparency feature that isn't yet available in any of the other major podcasting apps.
