Microsoft is planning to build its new Chromium-based Edge browser into Windows 10 later this year. The new browser has been available since January, but it has not yet been built into Windows 10 itself. That will change with an update later this year, named 20H2. Microsoft has started testing this 20H2 update with Windows Insiders today, and the company plans to use the 20H2 naming for testers and commercial customers and a more friendly name for consumers.
