Instagram is launching and testing multiple new features starting today that are aimed at making the platform a more positive space. The company says it's rolling out the ability to delete up to 25 comments at once and also block or restrict multiple accounts at the same time. The company says it's been testing these features and found that they especially helped people with larger followings maintain a “positive environment.”
