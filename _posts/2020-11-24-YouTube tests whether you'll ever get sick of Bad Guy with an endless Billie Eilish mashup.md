Somehow, perhaps by some cosmic intervention, I haven't gotten tired of hearing Billie Eilish's “Bad Guy” on the radio. Apparently, I'm not the only one because tens of thousands of people have gone to the effort of making covers of the song and uploading them to YouTube. In celebration of its music video passing 1 billion views, YouTube and Google Creative Lab have turned all of those covers into an interactive AI experiment. “Infinite Bad Guy,” which YouTube calls “the world's first infinite music video,” collects thousands of covers and blends them together, using machine learning to align each one within quarter-beats of the original.
