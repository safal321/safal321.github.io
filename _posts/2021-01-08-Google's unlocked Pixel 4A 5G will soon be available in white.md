Up until this point, Google's unlocked Pixel 4A 5G has only been available in black for those who want the unlocked phone. A white option was exclusive to Verizon's more expensive version of the device â€” more expensive because it includes millimeter-wave 5G. But soon, Google will be releasing a white model of the standard $499 unlocked Pixel 4A 5G for people who don't want to pay the mmWave tax.
