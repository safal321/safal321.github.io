You can get $50 off of the latest Apple iPad mini at Best Buy, bringing the starting price down to $349. This model doesn't often see a discount, and this matches the biggest price drop that we've seen so far. Every color and storage configuration of the 2019 iPad mini is eligible for the same $50 off discount. To get this price, you'll need to have a My Best Buy account. Signing up for one of those is free and simple to do.
