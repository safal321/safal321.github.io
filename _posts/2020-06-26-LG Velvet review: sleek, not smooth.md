I've used most of LG's flagship phones over the past few years. Enjoyed using them, even. But heck if I could pick them out of a lineup. LG has pursued an aggressively bland design language adopted in near-identical fashion by virtually all of its recent phones. The G7, the V40, the G8, the V50, and so on are all fine devices on paper, but they're only distinguishable if you can remember their specific screen sizes and camera layouts â€” and even then it's a challenge.
