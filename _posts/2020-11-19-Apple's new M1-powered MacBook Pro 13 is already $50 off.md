Saving money on new Apple products is usually out of the question, but the new 13-inch MacBook Pro that has Apple's powerful M1 silicon is already $50 off at Amazon. Instead of costing $1,299 for the base model with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, you'll pay $1,250. Yeah, it's a small discount, and apparently deliveries are currently taking between  two to five weeks. Saving $50 might not make it worth the possibly long wait, but this deal's here in case you want to take advantage of it.
