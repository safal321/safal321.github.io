The most recent Origin EVO15-S came out in early 2018. That was an exciting time for laptops because it was the first generation of the Max-Q design, which brought about thinner and lighter gaming laptops than seen before. Asus released the ROG Zephyrus only a few months earlier, and the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin and updated Razer Blade 15 — some of the first portable systems that had a hope of running AAA games — came soon after. The 2018 EVO15-S arrived at a time when the world was first starting to take thin and light gaming seriously.
