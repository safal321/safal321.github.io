US Customs and Border Protection has filed for a significant expansion in its authority to conduct facial recognition at airports. On November 19th, the agency submitted a filing to the Federal Register seeking to expand the ongoing biometric exit program, broadening the program's scope to include all air and land ports. The filing also shifts the program's focus entirely to facial recognition, at the expense of alternate methods like fingerprinting.
