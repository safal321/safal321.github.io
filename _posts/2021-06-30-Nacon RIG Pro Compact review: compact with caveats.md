Accessory brand Nacon recently put out its $50 RIG Pro Compact wired controller for the Xbox Series X / S (and Xbox One) consoles and PC, and I was immediately drawn to it. It doesn't try anything revolutionary, but I have a thing for controllers that drastically alter the shape of the console maker's reference design. In this case, Nacon's is a tinier, shorter take on Microsoft's latest controller, but the analog sticks and triggers feel just as large â€” some of the buttons are actually larger. There's less distance between where your thumbs lie on the sticks and where the triggers are, which should be a boon for people with small hands or those who just want to feel like everything is easily within reach.
