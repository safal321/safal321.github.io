The Sonos Beam soundbar is $50 off at Amazon and includes a free $20 gift certificate that you can use for future purchases. This model is Wi-Fi-ready, so if you have other Sonos speakers, those can be connected for multiroom audio. It also supports Alexa voice commands. The Verge's Nilay Patel reviewed it, and he found that it's easy to set up, and it provides a big boost in sound performance over what your TV speakers can likely produce.
