The colorful, 2021 iMac might become the desktop of choice for most people, however, when it comes to flexibility, few products rival the 2020 Mac Mini. It's fast and functional, and right now, you can pick up the base configuration at Costco (membership required) or Amazon for $600, its lowest price yet. The discounted, 8GB model is built upon Apple's eight-core M1 chip and includes 256GB of storage and Wi-Fi 6. It's also remarkably quiet, though, it lacks a wide selection of ports and doesn't support external GPUs, a notable downgrade from previous Mac models. Still, the drawbacks don't render the M1 iMac any less of a deal.
