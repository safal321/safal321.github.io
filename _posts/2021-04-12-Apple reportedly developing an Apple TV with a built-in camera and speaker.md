Apple is reportedly developing a new TV accessory that combines elements of its Apple TV with a HomePod speaker and camera for video calls, according to a new report from Bloomberg. Alongside it, Apple is also said to be working on a smart speaker with a display, similar to Amazon's Echo Show or Google's Nest Hub. Development of both devices is said to be in its early stages, with plans subject to change.
