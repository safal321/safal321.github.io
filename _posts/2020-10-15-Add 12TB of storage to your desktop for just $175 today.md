There are a few hours left before Prime Day 2020 wraps up, but there are still a bunch of deals available to take advantage of. If you are looking to beef up your desktop storage, Western Digital's 12TB desktop hard drive is on sale for just $175 at Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo, and Newegg. Normally, this product will set you back $250 or more, so if you need an excuse to add a lot more space to your computer, this is not a bad option. The product is pre-formatted with NTFS use with Windows computers, but you can reformat it if you are a macOS user looking for a Time Machine drive option.
