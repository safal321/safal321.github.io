Logan and Jake Paul moved to Los Angeles in 2014, at the height of Vine's heyday, and not long after found themselves crammed into an apartment at 1600 Vine Road with other young creators hoping to make it big in America's entertainment epicenter. Over the next few years, they became world-renowned celebrities (often for the wrong reasons), moved into gigantic mansions, and threw the types of obnoxious parties high school kids worshipped and neighbors dreaded.
