There are a few different versions of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds — the game that popularized the battle royale genre and inspired a legion of competitors — which you can play on everything from your underpowered phone to your high-end gaming rig. At the end of April, however, the list will be one entry shorter: PUBG Lite, the free-to-play version of the ultimate life and death fight specced for lower-end machines, is going dark on April 29th. New downloads were shut down on March 30th.
