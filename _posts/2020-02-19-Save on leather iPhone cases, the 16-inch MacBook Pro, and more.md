If you've been putting off buying a case for your iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max, iPhone XS, or iPhone XS Max, Best Buy has knocked 50 percent off of a few of Apple's leather cases, folio cases, and Smart Battery cases. Starting with the latest phones, you can currently find cases available for both the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max in yellow or green colorways. Instead of costing $50, they're currently half off at $25.
