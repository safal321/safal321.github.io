Google's Area 120 incubator is shutting down Shoelace, a local event organizing app that it's been trialing in New York City for the past year, 9to5Google reports. The company said the service will be shutting down on May 12th in an email sent out to users yesterday. “While we're very proud of what we have built and learned, the team has decided that now doesn't feel like the right time to continue investing in this project,” the email read.
