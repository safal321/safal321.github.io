The YouTube app on older Apple TV models has officially been discontinued as of today. If you have a third-generation device (the 2012-era model that predated the modern tvOS-based set-top boxes), you'll only be able to stream YouTube through an iOS device using AirPlay starting today, as noted by 9to5Mac.
