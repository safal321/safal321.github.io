The Chromebook Flip C436 has big shoes to fill. Asus is known for producing solid Chromebooks, but last year's C434 was the top of its class. It had a thin-bezeled, slim and light chassis, excellent performance, and a 360-degree hinge with a starting price of just $569. We called it the best Chromebook you could buy in 2019.
