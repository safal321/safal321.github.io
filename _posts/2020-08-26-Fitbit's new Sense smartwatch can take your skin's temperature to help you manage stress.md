Fitbit has debuted two new smartwatches, the Sense and the Versa 3. The $329 Sense is the flagship option and is the most capable Fitbit wearable yet. The Versa 3 succeeds the Versa 2 and will cost $229. Preorders for both watches begin today through Fitbit's site, and they'll release in the US in late September.
