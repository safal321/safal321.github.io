Facebook has extended former President Donald Trump's indefinite ban into a two-year suspension that will end January 7th, 2023. It will then reevaluate Trump's ban to “assess whether the risk to public safety has receded,” Facebook's vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, announced Friday. If Trump is reinstated and violates Facebook's rules again, the company will implement a “strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions” that could lead to a permanent ban.
