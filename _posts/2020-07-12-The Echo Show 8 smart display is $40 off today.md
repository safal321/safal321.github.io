Amazon's Echo Show 8, its 8-inch smart display, is $90 at Best Buy and Amazon. This model usually costs $130. Compared to the Google Nest Hub, its closest competitor in price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option if you want a slightly larger touchscreen, better-sounding speakers, and a camera you can use to video chat with friends and family. Additionally, it's the ideal choice if you use Prime Music and other Amazon services.
