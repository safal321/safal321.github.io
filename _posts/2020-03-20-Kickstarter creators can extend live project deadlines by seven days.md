Kickstarter is giving creators extra time to meet their crowdfunding goals. On Thursday, the company said any creator with a campaign live now can request a seven-day extension. To ask for extra time, they just have to email extensions@kickstarter.com from the email address associated with their project along with a link to the campaign.
