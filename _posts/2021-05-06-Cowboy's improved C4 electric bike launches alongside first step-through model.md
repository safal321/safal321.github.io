Cowboy, maker of some of our favorite pedal-assisted electric bikes, is back with two new models for 2021. The Cowboy 4 is a complete overhaul to last year's Cowboy 3 while the Cowboy 4 ST features the company's first step-through frame. Both bikes benefit from a new powertrain with 50 percent more torque than last year's C3 as well as a new integrated “cockpit” with Quadlock mount that wirelessly charges your phone as you ride. But that's just a start to the bevy of tweaks both big and small that Cowboy hopes will justify a price tag of xe2x82xac2,490 / xc2xa32,290 (about $3,000 USD) when the bikes ship in September.
