You maniacs sold out our second-ever Interface live event, with Uncanny Valley author Anna Wiener, in record time. Thanks to everyone who bought a ticket, and we'll look into finding a bigger venue for the next one. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to seeing a good number of you on February 4th!
