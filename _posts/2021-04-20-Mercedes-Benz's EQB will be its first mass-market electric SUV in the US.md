Mercedes-Benz has revealed a new electric SUV called the EQB at Auto Shanghai 2021. It's the first mass-market electric SUV the company will sell in the US after it canceled plans to bring its first mass-market EV, the EQC, stateside in February. It will be the second mass-market electric Mercedes-Benz in the US after the EQS sedan goes on sale later this year.
