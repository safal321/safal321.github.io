The Sonos Roam is the most focused, calculated product from Sonos yet. It's a small $169 speaker that's meant to compete with portable Bluetooth speakers that people so often carry everywhere without a second thought. But it's also designed to slot into Sonos' multiroom audio platform and showcase the versatility that comes with it. In fact, excluding the co-branded speakers that Sonos makes with Ikea, the Roam is now the cheapest way into the company's ecosystem.
