A few days ago Marques Brownlee declared 2020 “the year of the ultraminor Apple update.”  He's got good evidence for doing so: the iPad Pro, iPhone SE, and even the new 13-inch MacBook Pros are all fairly minor on paper. I think I can both narrow and expand that declaration, though. I hold out hope we'll see something more substantial this fall in a few products (looking at you, Pixel and iPhone), so let's narrow it to this spring.
