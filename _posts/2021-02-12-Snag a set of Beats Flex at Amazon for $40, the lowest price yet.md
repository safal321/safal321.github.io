The Beats Flex wireless earbuds are $10 off at Amazon in the black or neon green colorways. This might not sound like a big price cut, but this is a fifth off the total cost since they're normally $50. You can read up on everything that makes them a solid purchase with Chris Welch's review, but the notable highlight is that they're just as good to use with Android phones as they are with iPhones.
