3Doodler, the company behind the 3D-printing pen that lets users draw 3D structures in midair, is introducing a new toy for preschoolers and kindergartners. Called 3D Build and Play, the device looks a lot like a glue gun with a crank, letting kids fill molds with plastic filaments that can be assembled into figurines. At $29.99, it's one of the most affordable 3D-printing products around and is also safe for kids as young as four years old.
