At Best Buy and Amazon, you can get Bose's excellent Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones for $299 in the white soapstone color. This model usually costs $400, and if the white soapstone color isn't what you want (you must not like Dark Souls), the silver or black headphones are also discounted at each retailer, though only by $50 ($350). Though, if the color of your headphones doesn't make much of a difference to you (after all, we're all inside most of the time these days), then these match the lowest price we've seen yet.
