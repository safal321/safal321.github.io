Facebook is expanding its Community Help feature to let neighbors request and offer assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has announced. The feature first launched back in 2017 as a way for people to help each other aftermath of natural or man-made disasters, but now it's being expanded to help with the health crisis. The feature is rolling out now in the US, UK, France, Australia, and Canada, and will be coming to more countries in the coming weeks.
