Okay, hear me out on this. I really would just like Apple's next iPad Pro to be a laptop. Not a clamshell, but a Surface Pro type of deal: a tablet with laptop hardware and a laptop OS. I think there must be people at Apple who want this, too, so I'm now respectfully requesting that the company stop dilly-dallying and make it happen.
