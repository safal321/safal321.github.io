I mentioned in a recent review of the HyperX Cloud II Wireless that my ideal low-cost headset has to be comfortable, have great sound quality, and support for USB-C charging. Apparently, I need to raise the bar a little, as more headsets other than the HyperX can satisfy those requirements. The latest to do that is Corsair's HS75 XB Wireless, a $150 gaming headset made to work on the Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One without the need for a USB dongle. It also works on PCs via Microsoft's wireless Xbox USB adapter, which is how I tested this model.
