Apple's second-generation AirPods that include a wireless charging case cost $170 if you buy them new, but Best Buy is offering a very good deal on refurbished models if you want to save another $60. This refurbished set of second-generation AirPods is $110, the best price we've seen yet, and they come with all of the original accessories. If you want to charge them wirelessly, you'll need to use a wireless charger you already own or pick one up for less than $20.
