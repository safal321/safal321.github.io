Amazon is rolling out user profiles for Prime Video, allowing as many as six different people to track their viewing progress, manage watch lists, and get personalized recommendations. Kid profiles can also be added and limited to content that's safe for children under 12 to watch. The feature, which was spotted by NDTV and XDA-Developers, is rolling out in phases and is currently available in “selected countries” in Asia and Africa, including India.
