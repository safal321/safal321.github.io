As I write this the evening before you're reading it, the colossal caucus clusterf*** in Iowa is still ongoing and no official results are anywhere in sight. It seems clear that some portion of the problem stems from a poorly architected app. It's an incredibly bad start to the 2020 election â€” not because we should expect the results to be in doubt, but because you'd like to think regardless of politics we'd at least improve our competence at running elections.
