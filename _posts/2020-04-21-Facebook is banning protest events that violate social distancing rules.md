Facebook is banning promotions for protests that violate social distancing rules, the company has confirmed. CNN reporter Donie O'Sullivan wrote this morning that promotions for anti-quarantine protests in California, New Jersey, and Nebraska had all been removed after Facebook consulted with state governments. The company is also reportedly seeking guidance for whether New York, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania protests violate current shelter-in-place orders. “Events that defy governments' guidance on social distancing aren't allowed on Facebook,” a spokesperson told The Verge.
