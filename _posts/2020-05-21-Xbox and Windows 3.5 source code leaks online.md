Microsoft's original Xbox console source code has leaked online, alongside code for a version of Windows NT 3.5. The Xbox source code includes the kernel for the operating system on the original console, a custom version of Windows 2000. We can confirm the leaked Xbox OS is genuine, and appeared online earlier this month. “We're aware of these reports and are investigating,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge.
