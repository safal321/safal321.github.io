The next-generation of Xbox gaming is a little more complicated than what we're used to. For starters, Microsoft has released not one but two new consoles this week: the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S. Many of the initial crop of first-party games is also designed to be playable on its last generation Xbox, the Xbox One, as well as Windows PCs. And that's before we get into Microsoft's game streaming service, xCloud, which could mean you won't need any Xbox hardware at all to play many of the latest games.
