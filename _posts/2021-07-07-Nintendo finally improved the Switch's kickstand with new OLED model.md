Nintendo's new Switch with an OLED screen seems promising for people who've wanted a bigger, more vibrant display to play games. That's worth getting excited about (despite the apparent lack of spec improvements inside), but I'm just as pleased that Nintendo revised the truly horrible kickstand present in the original Switch. Instead of the flimsy, fragile stand that's prone to wobbling (or breaking if you're unlucky), the new one takes a page from Microsoft's Surface Pro tablets â€” and seems a lot better for it.
