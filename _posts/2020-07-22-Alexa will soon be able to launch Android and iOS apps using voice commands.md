Amazon is working on a new feature for its Alexa voice assistant that will let the software launch Android and iOS apps using voice commands, a first for Amazon's assistant and a bold expansion of its strategy to position Alexa as a platform-agnostic alternative to Apple's Siri and Google Assistant. Called Alexa for Apps, the new feature is launching today in preview form, meaning Amazon is working with select developers on how they'd like to make use of it.
