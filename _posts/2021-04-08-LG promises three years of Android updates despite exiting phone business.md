LG has announced a pledge to issue future Android OS updates to many of its smartphones despite confirming earlier this week that it'll be leaving the phone business altogether. The Velvet, Wing, and G- and V- series phones from 2019 or later should be getting three Android updates from their year of release, and “certain 2020 models such as LG Stylo and K series” will get two updates.
