Apple's new iPhone SE 2 combines some of the best components of the premium iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro with the design of the iPhone 8, all for under $400. But one key component missing, as pointed out by MacRumors this afternoon, is Apple's custom U1 ultra wideband chip, a lesser-known piece of hardware that was first introduced into the iPhone line last September. The tech specs page for the device is posted on Apple's website, and it leaves off the U1 chip under the cellular and wireless section.
