Razer's small form factor Tomahawk gaming desktop is finally available for sale â€” mostly. The PC's main appeal, apart from its size, is that you only need to worry about two parts: the NUC and the graphics card. Razer has a listing for a version that comes with just the NUC, which would allow users to slot in a graphics card they already own, but it seems to be marked as out of stock. The version that's available for sale today comes with an otherwise extremely hard-to-get RTX 3080 Founder's Edition.
