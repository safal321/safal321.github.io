If you're looking for some of the wider implications of The Mandalorian's first season in the new premiere, now streaming on Disney Plus, you'll probably be disappointed. You're not going to learn anything about the “darksaber” wielded by Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) or any more about Din Djarin, the eponymous Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal) than you already do. His goal this season is straightforward: bring The Child (“Baby Yoda” to everyone online) to its people. And in order to find The Child's home, Djarin needs to find other Mandalorians.
