Niantic is releasing a new Mega Evolution feature for Pokxc3xa9mon Go, bringing more powerful evolved forms of certain pokxc3xa9mon to the game. Mega Evolution was introduced to the mainline Pokxc3xa9mon series in Pokxc3xa9mon X and Y and continued in Sun and Moon, but it doesn't appear in the most recent games Sword and Shield, which have a similar feature called Dynamax.
