Instagram Reels already mimics TikTok in multiple ways, and now, it's getting one more feature from the popular video app: duets. On Instagram, users can now “remix” a reel, meaning they can upload a video next to another user's, building on top of the original clip. The feature is already popular on TikTok, often for dance challenges, under the “duet” function.
