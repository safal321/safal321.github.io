China has hit Alibaba, one of the country's biggest online retailers, with a record $2.8 billion (18.2 billion yuan) fine, after an investigation found the ecommerce giant violated China's anti-monopoly law, The New York Times reported. The fine, which represents 4 percent of Alibaba's 2019 domestic sales, is three times higher than the $975 million fine China imposed on US chip company Qualcomm back in 2015.
