For years, police have been warning about the dangers of crowdsourced detective work â€” but on Thursday morning, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of Washington, DC decided to do just that. In the wake of an unprecedented mob attack on the Capitol building, the MPD has released an open call for help identifying subjects.

The FBI has made a similar request, although neither agency has produced any arrests as a result of the photos.
