Amazon has fired two Seattle-based employees who publicly criticized safety and working conditions at its warehouses during the COVID-19 pandemic, The Washington Post reports. User experience designers Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa were both fired on Friday after they tweeted criticism of the company, and offered to match donations to warehouse workers. Both had also previously criticized Amazon's climate policies.
