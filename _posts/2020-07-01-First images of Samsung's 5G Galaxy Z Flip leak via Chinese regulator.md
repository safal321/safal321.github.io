Images of Samsung's unannounced 5G foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, have appeared online, thanks to a listing from China's TENAA certification center. MySmartPrice reports that the listing initially went live without the images attached, confirming some key specs for the device, but new photos have revealed its design. From the images, it looks as though the phone will be almost identical to its LTE variant, barring a new matte silver color scheme. The unannounced phone was also recently certified by the Federal Communications Commission.
