Almost every model in Amazon's Fire lineup of budget-friendly tablets is discounted. The Fire HD 8 is a good value at $60 (usually $90), and even the Fire HD 8 Plus with slightly more RAM and wireless charging support is $30 off; instead of costing $110, it's down to $80. If you want to step up to a bigger 10-inch screen with 1080p resolution instead of sub-FHD screen, the Fire HD 10 is a better bet. It's $50 off its usual price, down to $100.
