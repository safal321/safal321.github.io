In a sign that the iMac Pro is on the way out, the only model currently available for purchase on the Apple Store website is the $4,999 base configuration, “while supplies last.” As first reported by 9to5Mac, all build-to-order configurations for the iMac Pro have been removed from Apple's site (but may still be available at third-party retailers like Amazon). Apple tells The Verge once supplies of the base model run out, iMac Pro will no longer be available.
