Twitch is getting a new look â€” sort of. Starting today you'll see the site's channel pages slip into something more comfortable, to borrow a phrase; streamers will now have way more control over what their channel looks like when it's offline, with a more customizable home page, channel trailers, and more. The changes were first announced at last year's Twitchcon in San Diego, and they're finally rolling out today.
