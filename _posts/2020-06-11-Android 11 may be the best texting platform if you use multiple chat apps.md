The official beta for the next version of Android is out now, and if you have a spare Pixel phone, I really do recommend you check it out. If you don't, my recommendation is not to install it â€” betas are never a great idea on something you truly depend on, and your main phone is likely near the top of that list. I've been using a build close to what Google released today for a week and I haven't had any catastrophic crashes, but there have been some bugs.
