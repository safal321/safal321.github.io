Sphero, a long-time maker of robotic toys, has announced a robotic toy car that's designed to teach young children about the fundamentals of programming (via Gizmodo). It's called the Sphero indi, and kids can use different-colored silicone tiles to give the car instructions, letting them create courses and mazes (and hopefully learn how to logically solve problems while doing so).
