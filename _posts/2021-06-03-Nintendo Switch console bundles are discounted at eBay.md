At eBay, the highly rated seller Antonline is listing two Switch bundles that are a little more affordable than it'd be to purchase each of the included items separately. Starting with the most appealing bundle (in terms of value and what's included), the limited edition console with an Animal Crossing-inspired design comes with New Pokxc3xa9mon Snap and a one-year family membership to Nintendo Switch Online, which altogether costs $379 (usually $395). Note that Animal Crossing: New Horizons isn't included with this console. This bundle would make for an extremely good gift to yourself or someone else.
