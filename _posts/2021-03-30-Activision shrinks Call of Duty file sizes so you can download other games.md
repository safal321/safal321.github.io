Activision is finally doing something about the tremendous file sizes of recent Call of Duty games. The company is announcing that both Modern Warfare and the free-to-play Warzone will be much easier on hard drives after the next update. The space savings vary depending on what platform the game is installed (and which content packs you have installed), but they'll be at least 30GB if you have both full games installed â€” meaning you'll actually have enough room to install another AAA game if you like.
