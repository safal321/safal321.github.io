Riding on the uptick of people seeking home workout solutions during the pandemic, Peloton has launched an app for Android TV so you no longer have to stream from a mobile app to a Chromecast if you've got a TV that runs on the platform. The app is available today on your Android TV's Google Play Store for access to the company's live and on-demand fitness classes.
