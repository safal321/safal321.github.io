Apple's MacBook Pro with the new M1 processor is one of the best-performing laptops on the market for the cost, and that cost is a little less than usual today. Amazon and B&H Photo have each knocked $80 from the base model's normal $1,299 price. At checkout, you'll pay $1,219, which is just $20 more than the lowest price yet. In other words, if you've been waiting for a deal, today's not a bad day to go for it. Though, this price is only set for the silver-colored option.
