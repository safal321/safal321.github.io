Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red's latest game, has been in development for nearly a decade. It was first announced in May 2012, and it's had a rocky development cycle, with numerous delays and, in the final stretch of development, a required six-day workweek. But despite the long development, the game didn't review quite as well as CDPR wanted, meaning developers who had been toiling for years could have been on the brink of losing performance bonuses that were tied to review scores.
