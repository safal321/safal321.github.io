EA's Origin desktop app is getting a rebrand and a visual refresh, GameIndustry.biz reports. The client is now set to be called the “EA Desktop App,” and it will be faster, simpler, and include more cross-platform features, EA tells GamesBeat. Other improvements reportedly include a “better patching experience” for updating games and access to more information about how much time you're spending playing. You'll also be able to access EA's game subscription services via the client.
