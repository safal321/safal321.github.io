Amazon's Echo Studio smart speaker has never been cheaper than $170, where it's at today at both Amazon and Best Buy. If you're interested in an Alexa-powered speaker that sounds great with an interesting 3D audio feature and Dolby Atmos support, you should really check out the deal that Best Buy is offering. The $170 speaker includes a free Echo Show 5 smart display and a white Bluetooth-enabled Philips Hue smart bulb with the purchase (normally $300 altogether). So not only is this the lowest price, but it's a fantastic value if you want to go all in on Amazon's Alexa ecosystem. These complimentary products will be added to your cart automatically when you add the Echo Studio.
