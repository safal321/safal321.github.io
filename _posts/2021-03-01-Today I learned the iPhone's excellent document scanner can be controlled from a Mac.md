The iPhone's Notes app has a powerful document scanning feature built right into it, and today I learned that this scanner can be controlled directly from a paired Mac in a variety of apps. It's an incredibly useful tip for Mac users as it cuts out the awkward middle steps of having to transfer it from phone to computer, or grabbing it from the Mac's Notes app after it syncs. Shoutout to TikTok account @keyboardshortcuts for bringing it to my attention.
