Google will discontinue its emergency location sharing app Trusted Contacts in December, and has already yanked it from the Google Play Store. Instead, it's directing existing users to try similar but less helpful features in Google Maps. That's a shame, because while Trusted Contacts could let you find a family member even if they don't respond (say, if they are unconscious or in danger), Google Maps requires them to proactively broadcast their location to you.
