Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It's never a bad idea to wait until there's a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. The latest model, the Apple Watch Series 6, starts at $399. Despite launching in September, it already has a small price reduction. If that's a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched last month.
