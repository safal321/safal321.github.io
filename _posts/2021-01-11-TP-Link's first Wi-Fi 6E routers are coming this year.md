TP-Link is announcing its first routers with support for Wi-Fi 6E, a huge new upgrade to Wi-Fi that quadruples the available airwaves for faster speeds and more reliable connections. The first four routers it's announcing include a pair of mesh Wi-Fi systems and two high-end single-unit routers, including one that supports 10 Gbps speeds.
