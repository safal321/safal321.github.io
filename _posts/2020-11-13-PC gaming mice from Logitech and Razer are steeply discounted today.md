Some of today's best deals are on PC gaming accessories, namely gaming mice. The Razer Viper wired gaming mouse, shown above, is a good option that's steeply discounted today at both Amazon and Best Buy. Normally $80, it's $40. This is a step up in terms of specs compared to the other two mice listed below, considering the Viper has faster and longer-lasting optical switches and more DPI sensitivity. It's an ambidextrous mouse, too, with side-mounted thumb buttons on both sides, so it's built to accommodate either right or left-handed gamers.
