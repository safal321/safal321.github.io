For the first time in its history, Facebook is facing an organized boycott from advertisers set to begin July 1st. It's not from small companies, either â€” large corporations including Hershey, Honda, and Verizon have stopped their spending.

The companies pledge to stop advertising on Facebook and Instagram for at least a month.
