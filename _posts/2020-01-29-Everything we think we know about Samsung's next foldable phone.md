Samsung's next Unpacked event, where the company is expected to announce its next flagship phones, is taking place on February 11th, and the rumor mill has already given us a pretty good idea of what to expect. A follow-up to the Galaxy S10 series (apparently called the Galaxy S20) seems like a lock. But rumors also point toward Samsung introducing its second folding-screen phone at the same event, one that might look very different from the troubled Galaxy Fold. The new phone reportedly folds up flip phone-style, similar to the new Motorola Razr, which will be out on February 6th.
