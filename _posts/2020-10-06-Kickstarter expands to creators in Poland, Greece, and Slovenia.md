Kickstarter is letting more creators around the world use its platform. The company said today it's now launching in Poland, Greece, and Slovenia, making Kickstarter available in 25 countries. The company says more than 250,000 people from these countries have backed projects since Kickstarter launched, suggesting local projects could appeal to an already established backer base. Additionally, creators from Poland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland can now choose to fund their projects in their local currency or in euros.
