Apple's AirPods Pro are, once again, selling for $190 through Woot. These truly wireless earbuds with noise cancellation originally cost $249, with many retailers currently selling them for around $200. We saw this deal pop up around Black Friday 2020, and while it has come back a few times since then at Woot, it's still the lowest price we've seen yet for a new set. Apple makes a few different kinds of AirPods (including the newer over-ear AirPods Max), but this is the high-end in-ear model that sounds great and has a spatial audio feature.
