Tile is working on a new tracker that relies on ultra-wideband (UWB) technology, which would put the company in direct competition with Apple's yet-to-be-announced AirTags, according to a report from TechCrunch. The new tracker would go a step further than the company's Bluetooth devices by allowing you to know more precisely where a lost item is in relationship to yourself, without having to listen for a chime the tracker plays.
