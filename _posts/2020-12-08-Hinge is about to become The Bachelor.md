Hinge's newest feature takes a cue from The Bachelor. In a new tab called Standouts, daters can preview potential matches' responses to the dating app's prompts and give anyone they're interested in a “rose.” Users only receive one free rose per week, which refreshes on Sundays, so they'll have to buy more to give them out.
