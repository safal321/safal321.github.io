Back in 2015, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he had started a school to teach his five kids, eventually expanding it as a non-profit school for some children of SpaceX employees. He said at the time that his kids' school wasn't “doing things I thought should be done,” so he hired away his kids' teacher to help found the Ad Astra School. It did away with formal grade structures and put a focus on problem solving, per Musk's direction, and he paid for all the costs involved.
