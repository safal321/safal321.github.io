It's rare that apps come back from the dead, but it seems like that may be what's happening with Turntable.fm, a site that let users create their own radio stations and DJ sets with music they curated before it got shuttered in 2013. Even rarer, it seems like there are two versions involved in the revival: the original Turntable.fm site is back up and running (with the involvement of its original founder, Billy Chasen), but there's also Turntable.org, which will reportedly be launching in beta this April.
