Messaging app Discord has added the ability to customize your profile just a little bit more than you could before: on the desktop version of the app, you can now fill in a short “About Me” blurb, and, if you have Discord's premium Nitro subscription, you can add a banner image to your profile. Discord says it added these custom profiles on June 24th. I first noticed the change on Wednesday, but I haven't opened the app for a little while.
