Last month, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Watch 3 as part of its current lineup, and compared to its predecessors, it came with an expensive starting price of $400. Fortunately, the watch is now down to its lowest price yet. You can buy the 45mm size in black for only $365 on Amazon â€” this version of the watch usually retails for $430.
