Backing up your Android phone is always smart â€” and backing it up to the cloud makes it easy to reload your data even if your phone is lost, stolen, or broken. And now you can back up some of that data to Google's cloud storage service, Google One, even if you aren't on one of the company's paid plans, which start at $1.99 for 100GB of storage. If you've got a personal Google account (not a G Suite account), you can get up to 15GB of storage for backing up your mobile data (although that can vary somewhat, depending on what other services / accounts you have).
