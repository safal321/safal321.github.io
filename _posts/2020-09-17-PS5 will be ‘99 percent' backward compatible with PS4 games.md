Sony revealed the PlayStation 5's price and release date ($399 for the all-digital version, and $499 for the one with a disc drive, both out on November 12th), as well as the company's six launch titles that will be available at release. That's not a huge lineup, and you might be wondering if you can play some of your PS4 collection on your new PS5 as more games become available â€” and fortunately, it seems like there's a good chance you will.
