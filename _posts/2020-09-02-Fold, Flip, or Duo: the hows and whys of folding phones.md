I'm currently reviewing the Microsoft Surface Duo and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 — they're sitting on my desk right now next to another folding phone, the Galaxy Z Flip. All three represent different ideas for how to make a folding phone and all three are prohibitively expensive. Even if at the end of my reviews I have to go hunt down the socks they knocked off, I think it's incredibly unlikely I would tell you to buy either of them — or the Flip.
