You have another chance today to pick up Vizio's 55-inch OLED TV at a discount. Normally $1,300 for this size, it's down to $1,000 at Best Buy. The best price from late 2020 was $100 cheaper than today's deal, but if you're scrambling for a decent price cut in time for the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 7th, your search might end here.
