Apple's AirPods Pro have dropped to their lowest price yet at Woot, an online store owned by Amazon. Normally $250, they're $35 off. This brings them down to $215 today only. For context, this deal is a mere $5 cheaper than the discount that has been happening at Verizon for the past week. Though, if you get these now, you'll have gotten the best price yet on a brand-new set of AirPods Pro. Just add them to your cart, and you'll see the price drop.
