After a not-so-subtle tease from Sony on Wednesday, God of War protagonist Kratos is now available as a purchasable skin in Fortnite. Although Kratos is a Sony character, he's not exclusive to PS4 or PS5 platforms â€” you'll be able to buy the Kratos skin on any platform where Fortnite can be played, and players on all platforms will be able to see Kratos in-game, Fortnite-maker Epic Games tells The Verge.
