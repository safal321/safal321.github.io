Google Podcasts is going to give podcasters a better idea of how their episodes perform. The Google Podcasts Manager tool will provide more data on listeners, potentially helping podcasters sell ads, figure out what their audiences want to hear, and help them structure their shows more effectively. It's a feature that podcasters have been pushing to access. The information includes metrics around how their shows do on the platform, including retention data, like where people dropped off in an episode, how long they listened, and the total amount of time people listened.
