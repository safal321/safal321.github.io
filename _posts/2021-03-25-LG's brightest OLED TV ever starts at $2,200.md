LG today announced the pricing for its 2021 lineup of 4K OLED TVs. The most buzz-worthy part for home theater enthusiasts is the new G1 series, which includes LG's new “OLED evo” panel with a brighter picture than any of the company's past OLEDs. But the G1 doesn't come cheap: it's $2,199 for a 55-inch model, $2,999 for a 65-inch, and $4,499 if you want a 77-inch screen. LG says the G1 sets also “have an unbelievably thin bezel with included wall mounting leaving virtually no gap from screen to wall.” You're paying for both the superior picture and that gallery-like aesthetic here.
