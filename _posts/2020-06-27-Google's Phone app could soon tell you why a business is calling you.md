Google's Phone app appears to be getting a new Verified Calls feature that will show you a business' name, logo, and the reason it's calling you. News of the feature first appeared on a Google support page that was spotted by Android Police. The feature relies on a business supplying its phone number, your phone number, and the reason for its call directly to Google, which pushes this information to the Phone app. If the information lines up, then the phone app gives the call a Verified Call badge.
