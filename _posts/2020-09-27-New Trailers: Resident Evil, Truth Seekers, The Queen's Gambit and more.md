No spoilers, but I started Enola Holmes and I absolutely love Millie Bobby Brown in it, she's so charming. The looking-right-at-the-camera bit which I usually dislike (except for Fleabag!) actually works really well to give us her inner thoughts. Will report back once I've finished, but so far, it's a refreshing reboot of the sometimes-stodgy Sherlock Holmes universe.
