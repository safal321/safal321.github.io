Interested in improving the video quality of your own Zoom frame tenfold? If you've got a recent Canon mirrorless, DSLR, or PowerShot camera, you can now use it as a webcam and put everyone else on your video call to shame. As noted by DPReview, the company has released a beta of “EOS Webcam Utility” for Windows 10 that lets you plug in any of the below supported cameras over USB and have it serve as your PC's webcam. And this should work fine for most of the big video conferencing options, whether you're using Zoom, Microsoft Teams, BlueJeans, or another service.
