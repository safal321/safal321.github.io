The 65-inch P-Series Quantum X from Vizio is the company's flagship 2020 model, sitting just beneath its debut OLED in terms of picture quality. You can snag one today for $1,080 at Costco and Sam's Club or for $1,100 from B&H Photo. This size usually costs $1,530, so presumably, this is Vizio's discount for the Super Bowl on February 7th. One quick note: you don't need a membership at Costco to get this deal, but you'll be charged a 5 percent non-member surcharge that'll add about $50 to the total, whereas Sam's Club requires a membership. B&H Photo has no strings attached.
