Apple is considering letting users set third-party apps as the iPhone and iPad's default web browsers and email clients, Bloomberg reports. The company is also reportedly working on allowing third-party music services like Spotify to run directly on its HomePod smart speaker, bypassing the need to stream them from an Apple device over AirPlay. Although the plans are thought to be in their early stages, Bloomberg says that the changes could arrive later this year in iOS 14 and in an update to the HomePod's firmware.
