The $300 Moto G Stylus and $250 G Power can take excellent photos. That's not a sentence I thought I would write when I started testing Motorola's latest budget phones. They're both capable of shooting some of the most detailed, color-balanced photos that I've seen from a device at these prices, while undercutting Google's midrange Pixel 3A by $100.
