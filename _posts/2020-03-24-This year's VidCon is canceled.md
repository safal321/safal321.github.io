VidCon, an annual gathering of social media influencers and content creators, is canceled this year in the US. The show was scheduled for June 17th through the 20th in Anaheim, California. The company made the announcement on Monday and said it's looking to make the conference happen sometime in the fall, although organizers are still working on a plan. For now, tickets will be refunded. The team is also exploring virtual formats and seeking speakers who might be willing to participate.
