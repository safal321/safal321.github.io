An Apple support page has confirmed that the company's new MagSafe Duo wireless charger, which is designed to charge an iPhone and Apple Watch simultaneously, isn't compatible with its older 29W USB-C power adapter. If you're using an Apple power adapter it's best to use one of the company's newer 30W models, which replaced the 29W model in 2018 and retail for $49. It's an unfortunate revelation for anyone with the old chargers since the MagSafe Duo doesn't come with a charging brick in the box.
