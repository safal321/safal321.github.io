Nvidia is promising big things with its new generation of graphics cards. The GeForce RTX 3080 is supposed to deliver twice the performance of the RTX 2080 at the same price. It's even supposed to surpass the RTX 2080 Ti, providing solid 4K gaming performance for much less than Nvidia's last-generation cards cost. This is all while taking advantage of ray tracing and Nvidia's special AI-powered DLSS tech that boosts frame rates while maintaining image quality. Nvidia had similar promises before for 4K gaming with the RTX 2080. But with the RTX 3080, it's delivering on them.
