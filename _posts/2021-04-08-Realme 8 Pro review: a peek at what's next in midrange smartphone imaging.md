The Realme 8 Pro is a good, inexpensive Android phone that you probably shouldn't buy right now â€” at least if you're in the US. But it's also a preview of positive things to come to the midrange class, especially in terms of camera hardware. I have seen the future of smartphone imaging around the $400 price point, and it is good.
