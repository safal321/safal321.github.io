A group of Senate Republicans is planning to introduce a privacy bill that would regulate the data collected by coronavirus contact tracing apps. The COVID-19 Consumer Data Protection Act would “provide all Americans with more transparency, choice, and control over the collection and use of their personal health, geolocation, and proximity data,” according to a joint statement. It's not clear how the legislation would be enforced (the statement says it would “authorize state attorneys general to enforce the Act”), a potential sticking point to persuading Democrats to get on board.
