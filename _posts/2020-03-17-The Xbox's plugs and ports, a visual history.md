If you need proof that the Xbox has always been different from other consoles, look at the ports and plugs. From the original Xbox to the Xbox One, and soon, the Xbox Series X, Microsoft has upheld the tradition of implementing an I/O panel filled with all of the standards as well as a few ports that enable some unique features. In the case of the Xbox that released in 2003, having an Ethernet jack was evolutionary and helped to popularize online gaming for consoles. On the other hand, the Kinect auxiliary port was unique, but it never really went anywhere.
