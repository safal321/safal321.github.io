Woot, an online seller owned by Amazon, is offering a good deal on Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro console. Normally $399.99, it's $299.99 until supplies last. This sale price might be familiar if you were hunting for deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. If you weren't able to pick up Sony's 4K-ready gaming console then, you have another chance now. These are new units that come with a one-year manufacturer warranty from Sony.
