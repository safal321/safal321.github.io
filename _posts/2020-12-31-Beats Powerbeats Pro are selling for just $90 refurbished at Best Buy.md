You can snag a refurbished set of the Beats Powerbeats Pro, the company's latest truly wireless earphones, for $90 at Best Buy. This deal is exclusive to the green “moss” color variant shown in the picture above. Looking at new options, the price ranges from $130 to $180 depending on the color you want, so today's deal is worth jumping on if you don't care as much about what the headphones look like. And hey, if this shade of green happens to vibe with your look, then even better.
