It's official: Samsung's new flagship phones will ship without a charging brick in the box. The phones will include a USB-C to USB-C cable, but no way to plug it in to the wall. If it helps take the sting out of it at all, Samsung has dropped the price on its 25W charger from $35 to $19.99. If you don't have a USB-C charging brick, or don't have a high-powered one and want fast charging, you'll have to add $20 to the price of the phone.
