There are as many ways to make it on Twitch as there are streamers. Even so, there is a culturally recognized type. And you can picture him — yes, him — now, can't you? A young white guy in a gaming chair, playing something like a shooter or possibly an MMO, averaging hundreds or thousands of viewers with the subs and bits to match. This isn't meant to be prescriptive, obviously: your fav is probably not this made-up guy. But I think it's important to talk about who we typically think about when we talk about streamers because so many streamers don't fit the stereotype — and we should recognize them, too.
