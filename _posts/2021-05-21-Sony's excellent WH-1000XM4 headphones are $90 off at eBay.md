About once a month, Sony's flagship WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones get a $72 price cut at a few retailers. But today, there's a $90 discount happening at eBay that brings the price down to just $260 for a new set in black. This excellent deal comes from eBay seller Pro-Distributing, which has a 98.9 percent positive feedback rating. Orders placed today should arrive next week.
