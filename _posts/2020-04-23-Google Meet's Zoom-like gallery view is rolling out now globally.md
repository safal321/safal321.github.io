Google Meet's new Zoom-like gallery view is rolling out across the globe “gradually” starting today, the company said in a blog post, and it should be available to everyone by end of week, Google tells The Verge. Previously, you were only able to see four people on-screen at a time, but with Meet's new tiled layout, you'll be able to see 16 call participants at once. Google announced the feature was on the way last week.
