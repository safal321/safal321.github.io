You've played Fall Guys, right? The sleeper hit of The Summer That Wasn't from developer Mediatonic? If you haven't, well, I suggest you give it a shot, if only because it was the second biggest game this month on Twitch â€” and the second largest debut there this year. (Valorant's launch in April was bigger, but Fall Guys did manage to beat out Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the second spot.) It sold 7 million copies on Steam and was the most downloaded game ever on PlayStation Plus. Huge!
