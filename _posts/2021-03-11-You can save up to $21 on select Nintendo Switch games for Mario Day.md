Today is “MAR10 Day,” and although it is not Mario's “birthday” (which is September 13th), this day usually has some of the best deals on games published by Nintendo. Nintendo rarely discounts its first-party games, so if you recently purchased a Switch and want to stock up on some games, today is a good day to expand your game library.
