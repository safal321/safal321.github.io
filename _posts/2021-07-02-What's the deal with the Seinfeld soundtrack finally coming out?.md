The hottest album of 2021 is about to drop. The soundtrack of the hit ‘90s sitcom Seinfeld will be released on Friday, July 2nd (via Variety) on “all digital platforms,” though specific platforms weren't stated (it's now available on Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music). I expect to hear the bouncy slap bass-driven theme song that never fails to make me laugh blaring out of cars, apartments, and cafes this Fourth of July weekend. Believe it or not, there will be 33 tracks on the album, and it's apparently the first time that this music will be made available in an official fashion.
