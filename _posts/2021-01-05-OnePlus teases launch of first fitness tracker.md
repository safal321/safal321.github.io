OnePlus' Indian Twitter account is teasing what appears to be the company's first wearable fitness band. The company claims that the device, which Android Central previously reported will be called the OnePlus Band, will “help you achieve all your fitness goals and make your life easier.” It also suggested in a subsequent tweet that the band could track sleep. OnePlus' tweet links to a page on Amazon India which says the device will feature a real-time heart rate tracker.
