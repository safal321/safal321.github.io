Amazon is launching new lens options today for its Echo Frames smart audio glasses: two types of polarized sunglass lenses for use outside, and blue light-filtering lenses for staring at bright screens. The blue mirror sunglass options will ship on May 18th, and the “Classic” dark sunglass lenses and blue light filtering lenses will arrive later on June 9th. All three varieties will be available in the black version of the Echo Frames for $269.99.
