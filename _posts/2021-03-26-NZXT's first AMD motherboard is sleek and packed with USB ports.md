NZXT's first AMD motherboard is the N7 B550. Like the Intel versions that preceded it, the N7 B550 has a slick design with the option of either a black or white shroud that covers the bulk of the board itself. No doubt NZXT hopes the motherboard's clean appearance will make it an appealing option for anyone with a windowed PC case like NZXT's own H series cases.
