Yesterday's OnePlus event covered the high-end 9 and 9 Pro, but outside of that spotlight, the company has quietly revealed a smartly specced, less-expensive model: the OnePlus 9R. CEO Pete Lau confirmed last week that the 9R was on the way and would launch in India. It's now listed on the company's Indian website starting at xe2x82xb939,999, which is about $550. That's an attractive price indeed, especially considering you'll get one useful camera feature here that the $729 OnePlus 9 doesn't have: optical image stabilization.
