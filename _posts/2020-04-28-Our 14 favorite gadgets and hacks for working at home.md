If you're not used to working at home — or if you haven't done it lately — then getting your workspace together may take some adjusting to get things. Whether you're setting up in the guest bedroom, on your living room couch, or in a walk-in closet, sometimes you need a little extra to make it possible to type comfortably, meet online, or just concentrate. Sometimes it means buying a new desk, a lamp, or a monitor; sometimes it just means finding a household item that will make life a little easier.
