Google has given its Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL unlocked phones a big price cut that lasts until May 9th at 11:59PM PT, or until supplies last. Each size and storage configuration is $300 off at the Google Store, Best Buy, and Amazon. Considering that the smaller Pixel 4 usually sells for $799, having it down to $499 for the 64GB version makes taking the plunge a much more reasonable idea if you're in the market for an upgrade, but don't want to spend hundreds more on the Samsung Galaxy S20 or even the new OnePlus 8.
