Google and Microsoft both announced on Monday that two industry conferences, Google's Cloud Next in San Francisco and Microsoft's MVP Summit in the Seattle suburbs of Bellevue and Redmond, are being cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Google says it will be making its Cloud Next conference, an enterprise focused meetup dedicated to G Suite and other cloud computing tools, into a “digital-first” event. Microsoft plans to do the same with MVP Summit.
