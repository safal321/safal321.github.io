Zoom is adding a way for hosts to report meeting participants, according to the app's release notes published on April 19th (via PC Mag). In theory, that could help the company track down trolls that take over Zoom calls and share inappropriate material, a practice more colloquially known as “Zoombombing.” Zoom says the reporting feature will be available in an update that's scheduled to release on Sunday, April 26th.
