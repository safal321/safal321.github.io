Sonos ran an all-too-short one-day sale on its Wi-Fi speakers last week for Black Friday. The good news is that they're discounted once again at Best Buy and Amazon, though the price cuts aren't as steep. Both the Sonos One SL without microphones and the Sonos One (Gen 2) are $40 off at either retailer. This puts the One SL at $140 and the One (Gen 2) at $160. Neither are best-ever prices, but given that they're within $10 of their lowest costs, we thought you'd like to know about these deals.
