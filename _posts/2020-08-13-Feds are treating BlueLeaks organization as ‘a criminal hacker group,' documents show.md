The transparency activist organization Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) has been formally designated as a “criminal hacker group,” following the publication of 296 gigabytes of sensitive law enforcement data earlier this summer, known colloquially as “BlueLeaks.” The description comes from a bulletin circulated to fusion centers around the country in late June by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis. The bulletin's language mirrors earlier US government descriptions of WikiLeaks, Anonymous, and LulzSec.
