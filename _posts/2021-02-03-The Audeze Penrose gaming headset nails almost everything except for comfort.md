The Audeze Penrose has almost everything I want in a wireless gaming headset. Its high-end planar magnetic drivers deliver rich, balanced sound quality that's easily superior to other models I've tested recently. It's feature-packed, too, with individual volume and microphone levels, USB-C charging, a couple of options for wired connectivity (USB-C or 3.5mm), as well as support for simultaneous Bluetooth 5.0 audio connections. As a gaming headset, it's stacked â€” which it should be for something that costs $299.
