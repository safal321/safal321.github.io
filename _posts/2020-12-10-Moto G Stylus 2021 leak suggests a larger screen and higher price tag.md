Detailed specs and images of the 2021 Moto G Stylus have leaked by way of an early Amazon listing, as spotted by Phone Arena. This iteration on the stylus-having, budget-friendly device looks to borrow features from this year's Moto G9 Plus, including a 6.8-inch FHD+ display that's slightly larger than its predecessor's 6.4-inch screen. Amazon's (now removed) page lists a price of $341, which is unlikely to be the final MSRP, but it's a bit higher than the original G Stylus' $299 introductory price.
