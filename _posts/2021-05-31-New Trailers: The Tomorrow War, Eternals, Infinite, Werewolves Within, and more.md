So tonight is the finale for Mare of Easttown and there are so many threads that need to be tied up that I legitimately don't know how they'll answer all the open questions. I have a theory of who the killer is, and I don't think it's the same person who fathered Erin's baby. Will Mare ever find happiness? It seems unlikely, I'm afraid. But maybe she'll find answers or closure.
