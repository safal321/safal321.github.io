Razer has announced a miniature version of the DeathAdder V2 gaming mouse, expanding its lineup of shrunken peripherals beyond the Razer Viper Mini. It's called the DeathAdder V2 Mini, and it maintains the same hourglass design and simple button layout that mostly mirrors that of the larger version. Though, with a smaller size, people with smaller hands or a claw grip style now get a chance to comfortably enjoy most of what the best wired gaming mouse currently available has to offer. This new model is launching around the world today, and it costs $49.99.
