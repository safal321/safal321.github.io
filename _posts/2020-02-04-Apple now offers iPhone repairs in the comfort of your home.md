Apple has started offering a new repair service where one of its authorized service providers will come to your home or office to repair your device. The service, which was first spotted by MacRumors, can be accessed through Apple's support site, where under certain circumstances you'll now see an onsite repair option in addition to the existing instore and mail-in services. “In select locations, onsite service may be available,” Apple's support page reads.
