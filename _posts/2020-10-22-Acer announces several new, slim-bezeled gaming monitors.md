Acer has announced a fleet of new gaming monitors in its Predator and Nitro lineups. As with the company's laptops, the Predator line offers more high-end, feature-packed options whereas the Nitro line is value-focused and thus less expensive. Each of the monitors has minimal bezels, so they should work well with a multi-monitor setup if you want to put two or more of them side by side.
