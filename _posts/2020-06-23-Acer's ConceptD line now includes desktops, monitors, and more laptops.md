Acer is expanding its line of creator-targeted ConceptD computers to now include desktop PCs, monitors, and more standard laptop designs. The ConceptD line first started a year ago with the unique ConceptD 9, which had a large easel design and powerful components repurposed from Acer's gaming laptops. The company followed that up with the slightly smaller but similar-looking ConceptD 7 Ezel earlier this year.
