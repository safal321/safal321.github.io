Comcast's wireless service, Xfinity Mobile, is changing the pricing structure on its unlimited plans. The company will now discount additional lines on its unlimited plan: a single-line plan will still cost $45 per month, but additional lines become cheaper the more you add. With four lines on a plan, you'll pay $30 per month per line. That's in contrast to a previous policy of charging the same fee per line, regardless of the number of lines on a plan â€” a practice touted on its website as recently as yesterday.
