Microsoft is planning to bring music controls to its Your Phone app that will allow Android owners to see and control what songs are playing on their phones. The software maker has started testing this new feature in preview versions of Windows 10 today, and it's expected to appear for everyone in the coming weeks. Audio tracks playing on a phone will be synced to the Your Phone PC app, and there's even a mini player much like the built-in Windows 10 music controls.
