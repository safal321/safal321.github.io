The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles will both be available starting on November 10th, and you can ensure you'll have one on launch day by placing a preorder now. The Xbox Series S, a smaller, less-powerful alternative to the Series X with no disc drive and 512GB of SSD storage, costs $299.99. The Xbox Series X is Microsoft's much bigger flagship next-gen console, featuring a more powerful GPU than the Series S, double the storage to a 1TB SSD, and a 4K Blu-ray disc drive. It's $499.99.
