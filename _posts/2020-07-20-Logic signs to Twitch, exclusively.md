Logic doesn't like the internet — specifically social media: the masses who send hateful messages about him, the unmoderated horde of people who feel empowered to say “go kill yourself” to someone they deem big enough to be faceless. And Logic, better known offstage as Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, isn't a stranger to the churn of comments that power social media; it's how he made his name, he tells me, reaching people where they were by putting out his music for free online. “I was at the birth of the modern internet. I was at the birth of social media,” he says when we talk on the phone. Because he's sold millions of records and is, by many people's measure, one of the biggest artists in the world right now, he's become one of those faceless people. And he knows how famous he is, though it seems to make him feel a little uncomfortable to talk about. (“I hate the term ‘celebrity.' It's so annoying,” he says, and I believe him.)
