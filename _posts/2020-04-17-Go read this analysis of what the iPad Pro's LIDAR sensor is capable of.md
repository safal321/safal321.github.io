An in-depth analysis of the iPad Pro's camera array has given us our best idea yet of what Apple's first LIDAR-equipped device is capable of right now â€” and what it might be able to do in the future. While it's unlikely to be of much use for portrait photographs, the analysis points toward some intriguing augmented reality use cases for LIDAR. The analysis was done by Sebastiaan de With, one of the developers behind the Halide and Spectre camera apps, and the author of similar breakdowns of the camera hardware on the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone XS. All of them are worth a read for anyone with a passing interest in smartphone photography.
