The founders of Hipmunk are launching a new startup today that's aimed squarely at taking on their own former product. Called Flight Penguin, it's a Chrome browser extension that simultaneously searches a bunch of airline websites and then presents the results in a familiar format. Rather than taking a commission or affiliate fee, Flight Penguin will instead charge its users $10 per month â€” it's designed for people who travel a lot (or, since there's still a pandemic on, people who will imminently travel a lot).
