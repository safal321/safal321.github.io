Wyze, the smart home company best known for its range of budget internet-connected security cameras, has announced its debut smartwatch. The Wyze Watch will be available in two sizes — 44mm and 47mm — when it ships in the US in February 2021, and like the rest of the company's lineup, it's priced affordably at $20. Wyze's announcement follows the release of the company's first fitness tracker, the $25 Wyze Band, earlier this year.
