Like so many beautiful internet creations, Racer Trash started off as a joke. Last May, editor Alex T. Jacobs caught a double feature of Two-Lane Blacktop and Speed Racer on Ariel Gardner's Twitch stream. He typed in chat that he'd always wanted a vaporwave cut of Speed Racer, but that it would probably never happen. Forty-eight hours later, on Jacobs' birthday, his wish came true in the form of Speed Vapor, the first Racer Trash movie.
