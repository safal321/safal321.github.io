Water Resistance Tester, available on the Google Play store and spotted by Android Police, falls firmly into the category of “neat stuff we didn't know you could do with an app.” It tests the integrity of your Android phone's IP67/IP68 rating by accessing the device's barometer. Just download the free app, follow the prompts to press down firmly on the screen, and you'll get a swift pass/fail grade. It's simple, geeky, and practical, which is a combination we love.
