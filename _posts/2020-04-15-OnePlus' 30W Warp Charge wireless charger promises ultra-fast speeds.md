The newly announced OnePlus 8 Pro is OnePlus' first phone with wireless charging, and the company is adding the feature in a big way, with up to 30W speeds that can charge up 50 percent of the battery in 30 minutes. But those kinds of speeds come at a big cost: you'll have to use OnePlus' special Warp Charge 30 chargers, which cost $69.95 and $79.95 for the pad and stand versions, respectively.
