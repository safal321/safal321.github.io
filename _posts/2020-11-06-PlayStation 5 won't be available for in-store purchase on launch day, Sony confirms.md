After a hectic preorder season, Sony today announced that there will be no PlayStation 5 consoles available for walk-in purchases at retail stores on the console's launch date. The company shared the news via a tweet and blog post and is strongly discouraging eager gamers from lining up outside stores. If you do, it'll be for nothing. “All day-of launch sales will be conducted through the online stores of our retail partners,” Sony's Sid Shuman wrote in the blog post.
