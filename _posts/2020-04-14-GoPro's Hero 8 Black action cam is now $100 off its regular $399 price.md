Whether you're looking for a capable action cam for outdoor use or want to upgrade your vlog setup, GoPro's Hero 8 Black is a recommended option. It's especially worth considering today as its cost has been cut to $299, which is the lowest price we've seen for this model by a wide margin. It's usually $399 for the camera, and both B&H Photo and Adorama are honoring this deal.
