The Sonos Playbar soundbar isn't as new as the Beam (by a long shot, it was released in 2013), but it's a more powerful option. If you want to pick one up, Best Buy has refurbished models for $379, which is drastically cheaper than Sonos' own $499 refurbished price. The soundbar debuted for $699 and Sonos products don't usually drop in price this much.
