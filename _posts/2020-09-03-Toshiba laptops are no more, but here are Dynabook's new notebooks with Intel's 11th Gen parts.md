Dynabook, the company that took control of Toshiba's laptop operation before it axed that business earlier this month, is releasing two new laptops built with Intel's new 11th Gen Tiger Lake processors. Both laptops, the Portxc3xa9gxc3xa9 X30W-J convertible and the Portxc3xa9gxc3xa9 X30L-J standard clamshell, are less than 1kg (about 2.2 pounds) and have 13.3-inch screens. The company will release these machines in Q4 2020, and pricing will be shared closer to launch date.
