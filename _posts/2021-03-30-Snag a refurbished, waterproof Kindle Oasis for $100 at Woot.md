If you're currently searching for a Kindle e-reader to buy, the best one for your money is the Kindle Oasis. Normally, that wouldn't be the case, since they cost $250 new, but Woot has the 2018 version (the previous generation) available refurbished starting at $100. That price will get you the 8GB version with Wi-Fi support. Though, if you want 32GB of storage and cellular connectivity, the step-up model costs $140, which isn't a bad price. Currently, Woot has the graphite color of both models in “very good” condition, and they're covered by a 90-day warranty.
