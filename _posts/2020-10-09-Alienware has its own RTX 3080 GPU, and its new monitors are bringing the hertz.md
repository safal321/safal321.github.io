When it comes to pre-built desktops, I've nearly bought an Alienware Aurora several times over the years, because the company's toolless upgradable chassis and bang-for-the-buck has been pretty hard to beat. Now, the Alienware Aurora R11 and R10 Ryzen Edition have also become a way to get Nvidia's extremely hard to find RTX 3080 and 3090 GPUs â€” and they're like no RTX 3080 or 3090 you've seen.
