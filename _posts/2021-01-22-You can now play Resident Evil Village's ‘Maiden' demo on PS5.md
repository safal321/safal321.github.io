If you've got a PlayStation 5, you probably know there's not a lot to play right now — particularly if you've already finished the likes of Miles Morales, Demon's Souls and Astro's Playroom. But here's something to (very briefly) tide you over: you can now download the Resident Evil Village “Maiden” demo ahead of the full game's just-announced May 7th release date. It wasn't available in the PS Store at first, but it's been there for about an hour now.
