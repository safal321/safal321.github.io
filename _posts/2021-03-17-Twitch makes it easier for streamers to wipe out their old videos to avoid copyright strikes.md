Twitch announced in an email to streamers that the site has added new tools today to help creators see where they stand with takedown requests and copyright strikes. Twitch also added tools to let streamers mass delete their recorded streams. It's a smart move because it gives streamers better tools to play on the right side of copyright law. (If you don't, and you rack up enough copyright strikes, you get permabanned.)
