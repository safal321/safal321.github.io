I'll just come right out and say that I don't really think I've ever had a problem with sweaty palms in the 25 years or so that I've been regularly using a mouse. But my weather app is telling me it feels like 100xc2xb0F in Tokyo today, and I am not looking forward to my electricity bill this month, so if I can shift even one percent of the cooling burden from my air conditioner to my PC's USB port, why not?
