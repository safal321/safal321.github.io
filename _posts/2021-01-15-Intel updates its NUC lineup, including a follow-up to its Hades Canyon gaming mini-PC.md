Intel is updating its Next Unit of Computing (NUC) lineup of miniature computers with its 11th Gen processors, and it's again including a gaming-focused model. The NUC 11 Enthusiast is a follow-up to the NUC 8 Hades Canyon from 2018, which managed to pack triple-A gaming performance (not to mention I/O that rivaled a full-size desktop) into a tiny enclosure.
