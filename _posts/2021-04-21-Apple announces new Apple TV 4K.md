Apple has just announced a new Apple TV streaming box, replacing the Apple TV 4K that came out in 2017. The new model retains the name of the prior model but comes with a more powerful A12 Bionic chip that lets it play HDR video at higher frame rates. It's also powerful enough to support 60fps Dolby Vision playback over AirPlay from a compatible iPhone.
