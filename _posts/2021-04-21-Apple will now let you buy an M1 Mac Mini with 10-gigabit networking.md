The M1-powered Mac Mini can now be configured to included 10-gigabit networking, an option that the computer was notably missing compared to its Intel-powered counterpart (via 9to5Mac). The update to the 2020 computer seems to have come during Apple's store update that came with the bigger product announcements today, including a new iMac and iPad Pros.
