Samsung's Galaxy A51 is now available as an unlocked device in the US following its release via Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, and Xfinity Mobile. The unlocked 4G handset can be bought from Amazon or Samsung.com, where its price is listed as $399.99. If you've been waiting for a version of the phone without all the bloatware that tends to come with carrier devices, then this is the one to get.
