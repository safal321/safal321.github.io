The Volvo XC40 Recharge is barely out of the gate and the Swedish automaker is already unveiling its next electric vehicle. The C40 Recharge is only Volvo's second pure battery-electric car. A slightly shorter and more streamlined version of the XC40 Recharge, the C40 Recharge will be built on the same modular platform as the automaker's first EV and will go into production at Volvo's Ghent, Belgium, factory in fall 2021.
