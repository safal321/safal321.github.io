Satechi has released a new USB-C hub for your laptop to add all the ports that it arguably should have included in the first place. Although the port selection on the $99.99 USB-C On-the-Go Multiport Adapter is similar to other hubs, the high spec of each port makes Satechi's device worthy of attention. As well as laptops, it also works with USB-C tablets like recent iPad Pro models.
