ADT has settled its trademark dispute lawsuit against Ring, which it brought against the Amazon-owned company because of what it called a “striking similarity” between Ring's Outdoor Siren and ADT's blue octagon signs. According to ADT's press release and a statement from a Ring spokesperson, Ring will stop selling the current design of its Outdoor Siren and release a new version.
