Nintendo shipped 6.86 million Switch consoles between July and September, increasing its numbers by more than 40 percent year-on-year and reaching 68.3 million units sold since its launch in 2017. That's impressive growth for the company, since this quarter last year was a strong one â€” it saw the launch of the cheaper Switch Lite variant, boosting Nintendo's shipments by more than 50 percent on 2018.
