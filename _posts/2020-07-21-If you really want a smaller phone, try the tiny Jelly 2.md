Have you been lamenting that the new iPhone SE is just too darn big? Unihertz might have the solution. The Jelly 2, launching today on Kickstarter, is a truly tiny phone â€” the world's smallest 4G phone with Android 10, apparently. How tiny? I just tried looking for it on my desk to help inspire a good description for this sentence, and I eventually found it underneath my air conditioner remote. Now it's in my jeans coin pocket for safekeeping.
