Italy's data privacy authority has ordered video sharing app TikTok to temporarily block the accounts of any users whose ages can't be confirmed, Reuters reported. The order comes after the death of a 10-year-old girl in Palermo, whose parents told authorities their daughter was participating in a “blackout challenge” she saw on the app. The child died of asphyxiation, and authorities are investigating whether anyone invited her to try the challenge.
