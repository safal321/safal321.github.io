Venture capitalist Peter Thiel has put $10 million into a newly formed PAC backing a business partner's Senate bid, as first reported by Politico. Formed on April 19th, the Saving Arizona PAC is taking aim at the state's 2022 Senate race, which will see former astronaut Mark Kelly defending his seat for the Democrats. According to Politico, the PAC will support Thiel Capital executive Blake Masters in the Republican primary and general election, putting him at an immediate fundraising advantage in one of the most closely watched races of the cycle.
