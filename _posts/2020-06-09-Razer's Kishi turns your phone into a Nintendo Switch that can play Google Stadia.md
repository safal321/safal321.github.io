The trouble of finding a reliable gamepad to use with your phone was, more or less, figured out when Android 10 and iOS 13 added native support for the DualShock 4 and Xbox One controller. Still, Razer is trying to solve it a little differently with its Kishi mobile controller, an $80 accessory made in partnership with Gamevice that — by looks, if nothing else — turns your phone into a Nintendo Switch lookalike. It's a compact controller that splits in half, delegating an analog stick and D-pad to the left side, and another analog stick and face buttons to the right side. Each side is connected by a flat data cable that extends far enough to fit your Android phone's big, bezel-less, high-res display in the middle.
