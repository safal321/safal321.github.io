After months of teasers and leaks, OnePlus is launching the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro today. Both are powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 865 chipset, but it's the larger OnePlus 8 Pro that comes with the big display and camera improvements. OnePlus worked a 90Hz display into the OnePlus 7 Pro last year, and that's jumping up to 120Hz for 2020.
