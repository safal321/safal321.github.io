Twitter is now legally liable for content posted by its users in India after failing to comply with the country's new IT rules, the government said in a legal filing. As reported by both Reuters and TechCrunch, India's IT ministry argues in a filing with New Delhi's High Court that the social media firm has lost its legal immunity after failing to comply with new requirements imposed in May. These include appointing a chief compliance officer, a grievance officer, and a contact person to respond to requests from law enforcement 24 hours a day.
