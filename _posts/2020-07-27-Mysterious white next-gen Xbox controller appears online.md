A white Xbox Series X controller appears to have leaked online. An image of the white controller appeared on Reddit over the weekend, before the poster deleted their account and the image. Identified only as “Wolfy_Wizzardo,” the Reddit user claimed to have snapped the photo at a party in Washington state hosted by the child of a Microsoft employee. Before the account deletion, the Reddit account had been commenting and posting about topics in Seattle, Washington for months.
