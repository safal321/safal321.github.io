Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates recently announced their divorce plans but largely left the question of how the co-chairs would continue to work together at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation unanswered. Now, a new statement from the foundation has offered some clarity: they might not (via The New York Times). The foundation says Melinda French Gates will resign from her position as co-chair and trustee if either she or Bill Gates decides they are unable to work together after two years. It's not clear how the organization settled on that timeframe.
