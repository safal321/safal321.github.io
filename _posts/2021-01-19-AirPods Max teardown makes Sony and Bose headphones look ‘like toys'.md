iFixit's long in the making AirPods Max teardown is finally complete, giving an exhaustive look at the internals of Apple's debut over-ear headphones and an idea of how easy they are to repair. Until now, iFixit has refused to grant Apple a single repairability point for any of its AirPods, but the AirPods Max buck the trend with a surprisingly high score of six out of ten. iFixit even went as far as to teardown Sony's WH-1000XM4 and Bose's NC 700 headphones for comparison.
