At the beginning of this week's Epic v. Apple trial, Apple described Epic's lawsuit as an “assault” on the entire iOS philosophy. One of the iPhone and iPad's defining features is a curated ecosystem (or, from a different perspective, a walled garden). A loss for Apple could require it to allow side-loaded apps and alternative app stores, potentially including Epic's own Epic Games Store. Apple says that would damage the privacy and security that iOS is known for, making Apple spend more money to fix new problems that crop up.
