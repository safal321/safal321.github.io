Logitech is announcing an iPad case with a keyboard and built-in trackpad today, and it's way cheaper than Apple's new model. The “Combo Touch Keyboard Case with Trackpad” has a “full-size” backlit keyboard, a trackpad beneath it, and a case that wraps around the iPad. A kickstand in back offers 50 degrees of tilting.
