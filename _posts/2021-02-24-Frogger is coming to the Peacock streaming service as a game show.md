Konami's Frogger game series is apparently getting turned into a game show, set to be streamed on NBC's Peacock. The show's contestants will apparently have to go through “physically demanding” obstacle courses and will be asked to “dodge treacherous traffic, leap over snapping gators and hop over hungry hippos to conquer the course.” One would hope those are simulated using foam and rubber. Otherwise, there could be some liability issues.
