Not long ago, we wrote about how rollerblading is back — but that's not the only fun way to pass the time with wheels strapped to your feet. Roller-skating — which first became popular in the ‘70s, about two decades earlier than roller-blading — has also glided back into popular culture of late, thanks to shows like Euphoria, in which Zendaya & Co. tie on some pairs of old-fashioned skates and hit their local rink. But even though roller-skating predates rollerblading, there are lots of new roller-skate brands on the market, making new styles of the Technicolor wheeled footwear of your childhood dreams for all experience levels and budgets.
