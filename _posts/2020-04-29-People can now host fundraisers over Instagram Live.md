Instagram is making it easier for people to raise money for nonprofits today by building a feature that'll allow Live viewers to directly support approved organizations. Live stream hosts can decide what organization they want to support, and during their show, they'll be able to see how much money has been raised as it's happening, along with how many people are supporting the cause. They can also tap and view individual contributions if they want to shout people out or virtually wave at them. All proceeds go to the organizations; Instagram doesn't take a cut.
