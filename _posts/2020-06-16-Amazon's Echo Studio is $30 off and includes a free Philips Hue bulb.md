Amazon's Echo Studio is its first great-sounding smart speaker, and you can get it for $170 today. That's $30 off its regular price, which we only saw happen once before a few months ago. What makes this deal even better than that one is you can get a free Philips Hue white ambiance bulb for no extra charge. Since the Echo Studio uses the Zigbee standard for Internet of Things devices, you won't need a Hue Bridge to use the bulb.
