Google's Nest Wifi is currently one of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems you can buy because it's fast and easy to set up, and there's a big, steeply discounted bundle you should know about at Woot, an online company owned by Amazon. Instead of paying $349, which is the regular going rate for a router and two Points (what Google calls its extenders that double as smart speakers), it's $280 for the whole kit right now. Shipping is free for Amazon Prime members.
