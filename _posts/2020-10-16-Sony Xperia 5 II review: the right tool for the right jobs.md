More than any other smartphone I've used this year, the Sony Xperia 5 II feels like a tool. It's not just that it has a very understated design (though this definitely plays a part), it's that Sony's whole approach is to give you as much control over the phone as possible. Control over how it looks, and sounds, and takes photos and video.
