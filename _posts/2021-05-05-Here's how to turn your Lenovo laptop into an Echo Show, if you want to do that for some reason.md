A new Show Mode feature from Amazon is now rolling out to some Lenovo laptops. When you activate this, it will change your home screen to look like the home screen of an Echo Show smart display, in a similar fashion to the Show Mode feature on Amazon's tablets. That means you'll be able to do smart display things like controlling smart home devices, glancing at the weather and news headlines, and chatting with Alexa â€” you know, the kind of stuff you've always wished you could do on your ThinkPad.
