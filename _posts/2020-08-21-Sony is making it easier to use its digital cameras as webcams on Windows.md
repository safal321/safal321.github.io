Sony has unveiled a new program for Windows 10 that makes it easier to use the company's digital cameras as webcams. The software is called Imaging Edge Webcam and allows you to connect your Sony camera to your PC via USB without the need for additional hardware like a USB capture card. That means you can get a huge boost in image quality compared to most traditional webcams. Unfortunately, there's no mention of a version for macOS.
