The partnership between Verizon and Disney seems to be working out well for both sides: today, the carrier announced that alongside the free 12 months of Disney Plus streaming it was already including with unlimited plans, it'll now throw in Hulu and ESPN Plus, too. But the full bundle only goes to customers on either the Play More or Get More unlimited plans, which are Verizon's most expensive options. Unlike before, where the free promo was only good for 12 months, now you'll get continued access for as long as you remain with Verizon on those plans.
