Amazon's Echo Show 8 is the smart display that we recommend for most people, and now, it's more affordable than usual. Woot (owned by Amazon) is selling them for $80, which is $50 off of the usual $130 price. They're open-box models, though Woot insists that they've never been used. It also says that the smart display will arrive in its original box with all of the accessories, though it has a 90-day warranty.
