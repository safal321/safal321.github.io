Microsoft is now allowing Windows 10 users to run Android apps side by side with Windows applications on a PC. It's part of a new feature in Your Phone available to Windows 10 testers today, and it builds upon the mirroring that Microsoft's Your Phone app already provides. You can now access a list of Android apps in Microsoft's Your Phone app and launch these mobile apps accordingly. These will run in a separate window outside of the Your Phone app, mirrored from your phone.
