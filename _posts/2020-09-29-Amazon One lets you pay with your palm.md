Amazon is unveiling its own palm recognition technology today that will be used initially to turn your hand into a personal credit card inside the company's physical retail stores. Amazon One uses the palm of your hand to identify you, using a combination of surface-area details like lines and ridges, alongside vein patterns to create a “palm signature.”
