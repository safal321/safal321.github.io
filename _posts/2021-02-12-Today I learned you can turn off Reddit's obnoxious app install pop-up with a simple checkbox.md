My preferred way to surf Reddit is via the mobile website. It lets me quickly check a few of my favorite subreddits to see which posts are bubbling up. Since I'm not usually logged in, it helps me manage my screen time, too; you can only scroll down so far in comment threads until Reddit prompts you to enter your username and password. I take that as a sign that I've scrolled far enough and move on.
