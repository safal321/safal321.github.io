Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), the go-to software for streamers, is getting native support for Nvidia's excellent noise-removal technology, the graphics card manufacturer announced today. Although it was previously possible to get the same effect by combining OBS with Nvidia's Broadcast software, you'll now be able to adjust the background noise-removal feature directly from within OBS. It's currently available with the beta version of OBS Studio 27 and will be coming in a full release soon.
