Twitter is testing a way to let you watch YouTube videos right from your timeline. Typically, when someone includes a YouTube link in a tweet, clicking that link sends you to YouTube, which can be frustrating if you didn't want to leave Twitter to watch the video. This new feature, which is in testing today on iOS, means you won't be sent away from Twitter, which will make it easier to watch a video and then keep on scrolling if you so choose.
