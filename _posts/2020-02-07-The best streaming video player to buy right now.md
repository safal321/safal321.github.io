Buying a capable streaming player for your TV is easier and cheaper in 2020 than it's ever been. So long as you're willing to spend at least $50, you can buy something that'll deliver 4K resolution and HDR color from apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+. With universal search that spans all of the big services, streaming players make it easy to find something to watch when you finally make it to the couch after a long day.
