Samsung just unveiled the Galaxy Z Flip, its second folding phone. This phone's big improvement over foldables to date is the use of a glass screen, and it definitely feels a whole lot nicer. It feels like glass, and it can't be easily marked up by a fingernail like the plastic screens used to date. I tried my darndest to see the crease in the hands-on area and while I could see it, it wasn't easy. Of course, we were in a somewhat controlled and completely chaotic and crowded situation, so don't hold me to that long term.
