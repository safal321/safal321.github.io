Lenovo isn't a major player in the gaming chair scene, but its Demon Slayer-themed creation shows that it could easily dice up the competition if it chose to. Per Kotaku, the company has made a limited edition chair that has a holstered katana built onto its side. But before you imagine spinning around in the chair with a sword out, there's sadly no katana in the holster. Is it false advertising to make a Demon Slayer chair with which you can't actually slay demons?
