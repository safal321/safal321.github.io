In light of the novel coronavirus outbreak and its massive impact on the travel industry, Airbnb has tweaked its reservation policies to help hosts and guests cancel bookings without taking a loss. Until June 1st, Airbnb will waive the standard 3 percent host fee that it collects for hosts who refund more of their would-be guests' money than the Airbnb cancellation policy requires them to. Airbnb also says it will increase visibility of listings for hosts who take advantage of its new “More Flexible Reservations” tools.
