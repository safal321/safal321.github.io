Panasonic has announced the new Lumix G100 mirrorless camera (known as the G110 outside of the US) that's compatible with the full suite of Micro Four Thirds interchangeable lenses. It will be out by the end of July and, like the recently launched Sony ZV-1, it has several features specifically geared toward people who want to create vlog video content. With a preorder price of $749.99 (until August 1st â€” it'll cost $50 more after that), this could be a solid pick, depending on your needs.
