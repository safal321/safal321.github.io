A remake of the Nintendo 64 classic GoldenEye 007 has leaked online, and it's playable on PC using an emulator, Video Games Chronicle reports. The game, which was originally destined for the Xbox 360's Live Arcade service, includes the original single-player campaign, as well as local split-screen multiplayer, but online multiplayer and leaderboards are reportedly missing. The whole package has received a graphical overhaul, but players can switch back to the original graphics with a button-press.
