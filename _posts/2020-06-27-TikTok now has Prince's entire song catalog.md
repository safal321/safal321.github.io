TikTok has signed a deal with Prince's estate to bring the late artist's “full catalog” to its app, starting today. Prince was long protective of his work, pulling music from most streaming services before his death. But his estate began bringing albums back to services like Spotify in 2017. TikTok is the “first short-form video app” to gain access to his complete discography, a very specific but still notable superlative, given how popular the story format has become over the past few years.
