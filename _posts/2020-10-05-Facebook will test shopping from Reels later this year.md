Instagram only widely launched its TikTok competitor Reels in August, and it's already looking to monetize the format. The company announced today that it'll start testing shopping within Reels later this year and will also start making shoppable IGTV videos global starting today. Eventually, these IGTV videos will also be available through Instagram Shop, a dedicated page for shopping within the app. Viewers can just tap through an IGTV video and purchase the items they're interested in through Instagram checkout or the seller's website.
