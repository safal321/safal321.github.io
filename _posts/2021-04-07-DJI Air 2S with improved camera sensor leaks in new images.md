DJI's unannounced Air 2S drone has leaked in a series of images posted by TechnikNews and WinFuture's Roland Quandt. The images come after the drone was listed in an FCC filing last month, suggesting that a launch can't be far away. The DJI Air 2S is expected to be an upgraded version of last year's Mavic Air 2, with an improved camera and compatibility with new DJI accessories like its V2 Goggles and Motion Controller.
