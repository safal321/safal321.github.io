Google parent company Alphabet has settled a shareholder lawsuit over its handling of sexual misconduct. The company has announced policy changes related to the settlement, including a $310 million fund for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This resolves a complaint that was filed in 2019, following an explosive report that Google offered multimillion-dollar exit packages to executives who were credibly accused of sexual assault or harassment, including former Android head Andy Rubin.
