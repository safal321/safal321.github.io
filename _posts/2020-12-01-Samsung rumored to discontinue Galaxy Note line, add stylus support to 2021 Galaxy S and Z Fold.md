Samsung will reportedly discontinue its Galaxy Note phone line in 2021, according to Reuters, as the company contends with falling demand for pricey smartphones caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the company is set to focus on its flagship Galaxy S lineup of phones, while Samsung's foldable phones (like the Z Flip and Z Fold) will take the place of the Galaxy Note as Samsung's more experimental premium devices, complete with an optional stylus accessory.
