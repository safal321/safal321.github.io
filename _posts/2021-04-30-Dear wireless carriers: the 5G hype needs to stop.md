Just stop. Stop telling us why your 5G network is the very best and fastest and most reliable. Stop running commercials about how life-changing your 5G network is. Definitely stop telling us why your 5G network is better than the other guy's 5G network because can you even imagine building a 5G network the way they have? Please stop with all of this, it's been a very long year and we're tired.
