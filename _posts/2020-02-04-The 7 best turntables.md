The world of record players and vinyl can be intimidating to the uninitiated because the gear that playing records requires (preamps, amps, receivers) can make it seem like an expensive, overly complicated hobby. But that's not true, according to the experts we spoke with — including DJs, record store owners, and general vinyl geeks — all of whom assured us that you don't need more than a turntable and a pair of powered speakers, or speakers with a built-in amplifier, to get started (Audioengine powered speakers, like the A2+ model on this list, are a good brand to start with, according to DJ Prestige of Flea Market Funk).
