Left 4 Dead 2, Valve's iconic zombie shooter, turns 11 next month. Today, the game gets a final, massive update â€” The Last Stand, created by the Left 4 Dead community update team and endorsed by Valve itself. It's also the first new content added to the game since 2012, according to Polygon. (That was the community-made DLC Cold Stream.)
