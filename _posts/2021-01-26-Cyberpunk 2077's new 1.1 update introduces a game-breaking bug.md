Cyberpunk 2077's big new 1.1 patch has introduced a game-breaking bug. Eurogamer reports that the “Down on the Street” quest appears to be broken for some players. The quest includes a holocall that's supposed to trigger progress through the main part of Cyberpunk 2077's storyline. Unfortunately, some players are reporting that the call remains silent, and it blocks progress of the game.
